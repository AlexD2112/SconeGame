    "text": "Castle in Aberdeen, Scotland\nAberdeen Castle was a late Middle Ages fortification,[1] in Aberdeen, Scotland.[2] It was situated on Castle Hill, a site today known as the Castlegate, and the location of the castle is now occupied by blocks of flats.[3]\nBurned and demolished\nIt is thought the castle and fortifications were slighted[4] by King Robert the Bruce as was his policy on recaptured castles in June 1308, during the Wars of Scottish Independence immediately following the Harrying of Buchan. Bruce and his men laid siege to the castle before massacring the English Garrison to prevent its use by the English troops of Edward II. It is said the Scots showed no mercy but \"slew every man who fell into their hands. Edward I, indeed, had already set the example of executing his prisoners. It was not to be expected that the other side would fail to follow the same course\"[5] However, as of August 1308, Gilbert Pecche and the last troops were allowed to leave Aberdeen; this obviously cannot be accurate.[1] On 10 July 1308, English ships left Hartlepool to help the English garrison.[6] Legend tells that the city's motto, Bon Accord, came from the password used to initiate Bruce's final push and destruction of the castle.[7][8]\nSurrender to the English\nThe castle was surrendered to the English in 1295, and on 14 April 1296, the English King, Edward I arrived in Aberdeen and stayed in the castle as part of his suppression of the east coast of Scotland, having defeated the Scots.[9]\nWallace\nHowever, the following year, after defeating the English at Dunnottar Castle in 1297, William Wallace marched his men to Aberdeen during their campaign to retake the east coast for the Scots.\nThey found the English hastily preparing to leave in an armada of one hundred ships. The speed of Wallace's arrival from Dunottar caught the English unawares, and at low tide, the stranded ships were attacked in the harbour, the crew and soldiers slaughtered, the cargo taken, and the ships burnt.\nJohn Balliol\nThe English Sheriff of Aberdeen, Sir Henry de Lazom had been left in charge of the Castle, but during the chaos of the attack, he defected, declaring it in the name of the Scottish King, John Balliol.[10][11]\nReferences\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle and museum in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, UK\nDelgatie Castle is a castle near Turriff, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nA castle has stood on the site of Delgatie Castle since the year 1030 AD, although the earliest parts of the castle standing today were built between 1570 and 1579.[1] Additional wings and a chapel were added in 1743.\nThe castle was stripped from the disgraced Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, after the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and given to Clan Hay (later to become the Earls of Erroll). Mary, Queen of Scots, was a guest at the castle in 1562 after the Battle of Corrichie.[2]\nLike many castles, Delgatie is rumoured to be haunted. A number of reports of a ghostly red-haired figure, supposedly one Alexander Hay, were made by soldiers posted there during the Second World War. The castle's information boards, mostly written by Captain Hay who restored the house in the 1950s, recount that the ghost was first seen when a body was found bricked up in a priest hole.\nArchitecturally, the castle consists of a keep, adjoining house and two later wings. Notable features include a very wide turnpike stair and painted ceilings dating from the 16th century in two of the rooms, one dating from 1592, and the other from 1597.[3] In many places may be seen the Hay family arms including the three cattle yokes which recall a farmer and his two sons who were instrumental in the defeat of a Danish raiding party at Cruden Bay. (See Clan Hay for more detail.)\nToday, the castle and its gardens are owned by the Delgatie Castle Trust. The castle, grounds and café are open to the public throughout the summer months and suites within the castle itself and a number of cottages on the estate are available to rent. There is also a popular fishing site on the river passing through.\nGallery Delgatie Castle in 2017 Painted ceiling in Delgatie Castle\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Delgatie Castle.\nDelgatie Castle website\nReferences\n57°32′39″N 2°24′43″W / 57.5443°N 2.4120°W / 57.5443; -2.4120\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_Castle",
    "text": "Tower house in Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nDrum Castle is a castle near Drumoak in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. For centuries it was the seat of the chief of Clan Irvine.[1] The place-name Drum is derived from Gaelic druim, 'ridge'.[2] The site is located approximately 6+1⁄2 miles (10.5 kilometres) northeast of Banchory and 3 miles (5 kilometres) west of Peterculter. The property is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland and is open to the public.\nHistory\nThe original 13th-century tower of Drum Castle has been suggested as the work of medieval architect Richard Cementarius, who built the Brig o' Balgownie, the first Bridge of Don, in Old Aberdeen. It is believed to be one of the three oldest tower houses in Scotland (and notably unaltered). A large wing was added in 1619 by the 9th laird, and further alterations were made during the Victorian era.\nThe castle and its grounds were granted to William de Irwyn in 1323 by Robert the Bruce, and remained in the possession of Clan Irvine until 1975. William de Irwyn (of the Irvings of Bonshaw clan) was armour bearer/secretary (and neighbour) to King Robert the Bruce. In June 1636 Sir Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum and his wife Magdalene Scrimgeour were censured for harbouring the outlaw Gilderoy.[3] Drum played a role in the Covenanting Rebellion (as did nearby Muchalls Castle) leading to its being attacked and sacked three times.\nThe castle in 1829 (by John Preston Neale)\nIn the 19th century, it was the home of Alexander Forbes Irvine of Drum FRSE (1818–1892).[4] He had inherited the estate in 1861, on the death of his father. In 1875/1876, he arranged for a restoration of the courtyard, and the addition of an arched entrance and angle tower.[5][6] He was also partly responsible for a restoration of the chapel.[7]\nThere was an older church located here; it was modified to create the chapel in the 1500s and 1600s. In 1857, the west window was enlarged and the cross was added; a new roof was also installed and some restoration of the interior was completed.[8][9]\nThe site was once served by Drum railway station on the Deeside Railway. Service was discontinued in 1951.\nRecent status\nThe castle has been a Category-A Listed property since 1987. The report states that the agreement with the National Trust was made in 1964 by Mr H.Q. Forbes Irvine, the 24th Laird, and that the agreement came into force in 1976, after 650 years of ownership by the Irvine Lairds. The summary states that the tower was built in 1280–1300, that the Jacobean Wing was added in 1619 and that modifications were made ca. 1800, 1840 and 1875. The Chapel is Category-B Listed as are the Walled Garden and East Lodge; in 1987, the garden was \"derelict\".[10]\nThe chapel, dining hall and estate may be hired for weddings and corporate functions. The current (early 2020) NTS website, however, discusses its Garden of Historic Roses, spread out over four distinct areas. The grand Victorian library with over 4,000 books was one of the attractions; the castle was also offering a \"programme of temporary exhibitions throughout the year\".[11][12] A tourism website added that the castle \"contains superb furniture and paintings. In the 16th-century chapel are a beautiful stained glass window and the Augsburg silver Madonna\". The site has a playground, a small shop and a tearoom.[13]\nThe castle, gardens and estate are open to visitors throughout the year.[14] During 2019, 47,446 people visited the castle.[15]\nArea's ancient history\nPrehistoric habitation of the local area is known through archaeological sites such as Balbridie. Roman legions marched from Raedykes to nearby Normandykes as they sought higher ground evading the bogs of Red Moss and other low-lying mosses associated with the Burn of Muchalls. That march used the Elsick Mounth, one of the ancient trackways crossing the Grampian Mountains; the situation of the Elsick Mounth terminating at a ford to the River Dee is thought to have been instrumental in the strategic siting of Drum Castle as a point to monitor traffic on the Elsick Mounth[16] lying west of Netherley.\nGallery The Rose Garden at Drum Castle Walled Garden, Drum Castle Gateway of the Walled Garden at Drum Castle North-East corner of the Walled Garden at Drum Castle Southern boundary of the Walled Garden at Drum Castle Drum Castle Chapel Drum Castle chapel Interior & Altar\nReferences\nExternal links\nDrum Castle at National Trust of Scotland\nSummer Snow - Cottonwood tree at Drum Castle\nViews of Drum Castle and chapel\n360 Virtual Tour of Drum Castle Grounds\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Ruined castle in Scotland\nRemains of Dundarg Castle, and the modern house on the site, overlooking Aberdour Bay\nDundarg Castle is a ruined castle about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north-northeast of New Aberdour, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, built within the ramparts of an earlier Iron Age promontory fort.[1] It was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of North-East Aberdeenshire,[2] and by Charles McKean as \"Scotland's answer to Tintagel\".[3] It became a small Celtic monastery for a period.[4]\nStructure\nThe site consists of a triangle of gently sloping ground flanked by steep slopes on all sides, linked to a flat-topped elongated promontory extending to the north-east, surrounded by 20 metres (66 ft) high sandstone cliffs.[5] Its name comes from the Gaelic dun dearg, meaning red fort or castle, referring to the colour of the sandstone.[5]\nHistory\nThe 10th-century Book of Deer records the existence of a cathair or fortified place at Aberdour.[5]\nIt was built in the 13th century by the Comyn family, but was dismantled, probably by Robert the Bruce, in 1308. It was rebuilt in 1334 by Henry de Beaumont, but slighted almost immediately, after a famous siege by Sir Andrew Moray. Many medieval objects providing evidence of this double destruction were found in excavations in 1911-12 and 1950-51, led by W. Douglas Simpson.\nThe only substantial part of the castle remaining is the inner gatehouse, which survives to a height of about 18 feet (5.5 m). The upper part was rebuilt in the middle of the 16th century, probably following the Coastal Defence Commission of 1550, and there is some evidence that it was provided with gunloops at that time. The site was finally abandoned in the mid-17th century. A house was built on part of the site in 1938, reputedly by and for Wing Commander David Vaughan Carnegie, using stone from the former Aberdour Free Church.[6][7]\nThe castle and promontory fort are protected as a scheduled monument,[8] while the modern house is a category B listed building.[7]\nReferences\nBibliography\nBeveridge, W.

    "text": "Ruined castle in Scotland\nFor ships of this name, see RMS Dunottar Castle and MS Dunnottar Castle.\n\"Dunnottar\" redirects here. For other uses, see Dunnottar (disambiguation).\nDunnottar Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Fhoithear, \"fort on the shelving slope\")[1] is a ruined medieval fortress located upon a rocky headland on the northeast coast of Scotland, about 2 miles (3 kilometres) south of Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire. The surviving buildings are largely of the 15th and 16th centuries, but the site is believed to have been fortified in the Early Middle Ages. Dunnottar has played a prominent role in the history of Scotland through to the 18th-century Jacobite risings because of its strategic location and defensive strength.\nDunnottar is best known as the place where the Honours of Scotland, the Scottish crown jewels, were hidden from Oliver Cromwell's invading army in the 17th century. The property of the Keiths from the 14th century, and the seat of the Earl Marischal, Dunnottar declined after the last Earl forfeited his titles by taking part in the Jacobite rebellion of 1715. The castle was restored in the 20th century and is now open to the public.\nThe ruins of the castle are spread over 1.4 hectares (3+1⁄2 acres), surrounded by steep cliffs that drop to the North Sea, 160 feet (50 metres) below. A narrow strip of land joins the headland to the mainland, along which a steep path leads up to the gatehouse. The various buildings within the castle include the 14th-century tower house as well as the 16th-century palace. Dunnottar Castle is a scheduled monument,[2] and twelve structures on the site were listed buildings.[3]\nHistory\nEarly Middle Ages\nThis historic view of Dunnottar Castle by the Dutch engineer John Slezer is now recognised as an incorrect labelling by his engraver. It is actually Wemyss Castle in Fife\nA chapel at Dunnottar is said to have been founded by St Ninian in the 5th century,[4] although it is not clear when the site was first fortified, but in any case the legend is late and highly implausible. Possibly the earliest written reference to the site is found in the Annals of Ulster which record two sieges of 'Dún Foither' in 681 and 694. The earlier event has been interpreted as an attack by Brude, the Pictish king of Fortriu, to extend his power over the north-east coast of Scotland.[5] The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba records that King Donald II of Scotland, the first ruler to be called rí Alban (King of Alba), was killed at Dunnottar during an attack by Vikings in 900.[6] The English king Æthelstan led a force into Scotland in 934, and raided as far north as Dunnottar according to the account of Symeon of Durham.[7]\nW. D. Simpson speculated that a motte might lie under the present castle, but excavations in the 1980s failed to uncover substantive evidence of early medieval fortification. The discovery of a group of Pictish stones at Dunnicaer, a nearby sea stack, has prompted speculation that Dún Foither was actually located on the adjacent headland of Bowduns, 3 miles (5 km) to the north.[8]\nLater Middle Ages\nDuring the reign of King William the Lion (ruled 1165–1214), Dunnottar was a centre of local administration for The Mearns.[9] The castle is named in the Roman de Fergus, an early 13th-century Arthurian romance, in which the hero Fergus must travel to Dunnottar to retrieve a magic shield.[10][11] In May 1276, a church on the site was consecrated by William Wishart, Bishop of St Andrews.[10] The poet Blind Harry relates that William Wallace captured Dunnottar from the English in 1297, during the Wars of Scottish Independence. He is said to have imprisoned 4,000 English prisoners of war in the church and burned them alive.[4]\nIn 1336, Edward III of England ordered William Sinclair, 8th Baron of Roslin, to sail eight ships to the partially ruined Dunnottar for the purpose of rebuilding and fortifying the site as a forward resupply base for his northern campaign. Sinclair took with him 160 soldiers, horses, and a corps of masons and carpenters.[12] Edward himself visited in July,[13] but the English efforts were undone before the end of the year when the Scottish Regent Sir Andrew Murray led a force that captured and again destroyed the defences of Dunnottar.[4]\nIn the 14th century, Dunnottar was granted to William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland (d.1370);[14] in 1346, a licence to crenellate was issued by David II.[15][16] Around 1359, William Keith, Marischal of Scotland, married Margaret Fraser, niece of Robert the Bruce, and was granted the barony of Dunnottar at this time. Keith then gave the lands of Dunnottar to his daughter Christian and son-in-law William Lindsay of Byres, but in 1392 an excambion (exchange) was agreed whereby Keith regained Dunnottar and Lindsay took lands in Fife.[14][17] William Keith completed construction of the tower house at Dunnottar, but was excommunicated for building on the consecrated ground associated with the parish church. Keith had provided a new parish church closer to Stonehaven, but was forced to write to the Pope, Benedict XIII, who issued a bull in 1395 lifting the excommunication.[14] William Keith's descendants were made Earls Marischal in the mid 15th century, and they held Dunottar until the 18th century.[4]\n16th-century rebuilding\nGeorge Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, painted by Cosmo Alexander\nJames IV came to Dunnottar on 15 October 1504. A child played a musical instrument called a monochord for him, and he gave money to poor people. The king had brought his Italian minstrels and an African drummer, known as the \"More taubronar\".[18]\nThrough the 16th century, the Keiths improved and expanded their principal seats: at Dunnottar and also at Keith Marischal in East Lothian. James IV visited Dunnottar in 1504, and in 1531 James V exempted the Earl's men from military service on the grounds that Dunnottar was one of the \"principall strenthis of our realme\".[19] Mary, Queen of Scots, visited in 1562 after the Battle of Corrichie,[20][21] and returned in 1564.[4] James VI stayed for 10 days in 1580, as part of his progress through Fife and Angus,[22] during which a meeting of the Privy Council was convened at Dunnottar.[23] King James came again on 17 April 1589 and spent the night at Cowie watching for the Catholic rebel earls of Huntly and Erroll.[24] During the rebellion of Catholic nobles in 1592, Dunnottar was captured by Captain Carr on behalf of the Earl of Huntly, but was restored to Lord Marischal just a few weeks later.[25]\nIn 1581, George Keith succeeded as 5th Earl Marischal, and began a large-scale reconstruction that saw the medieval fortress converted into a more comfortable home. As the founder of Marischal College in Aberdeen, the 5th Earl valued Dunnottar as much for its dramatic situation as for its security.[26] A \"palace\" comprising a series of ranges around a quadrangle was built on the north-eastern cliffs, creating luxurious living quarters with sea views. The 13th-century chapel was restored and incorporated into the quadrangle.[15] An impressive stone gatehouse was constructed, now known as Benholm's Lodging, featuring numerous gun ports facing the approach. Although impressive, these are likely to have been fashionable embellishments rather than genuine defensive features.[27] The earl had a suite of 'Samson' tapestries which may have represented his religious outlook.[28]\nCivil wars\nFurther information: Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms\nWilliam Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, painted by George Jamesone in 1636\nIn 1639, William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, came out in support of the Covenanters, a Presbyterian movement who opposed the established Episcopal Church and the changes which Charles I was attempting to impose. With James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, he marched against the Catholic James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne, Earl of Huntly, and defeated an attempt by the Royalists to seize Stonehaven. However, when Montrose changed sides to the Royalists and marched north, Marischal remained in Dunnottar, even when given command of the area by Parliament, and even when Montrose burned Stonehaven.[29]\nMarischal then joined with the Engager faction, who had made a deal with the king, and led a troop of horse to the Battle of Preston (1648) in support of the royalists.[29] Following the execution of Charles I in 1649, the Engagers gave their allegiance to his son and heir. Charles II was proclaimed king, arriving in Scotland in June 1650. He visited Dunnottar in July 1650,[29] but his presence in Scotland prompted Oliver Cromwell to lead a force into Scotland, defeating the Scots at Dunbar in September 1650.[30]\nHonours of Scotland\nCharles II was crowned at Scone Palace on 1 January 1651, at which the Honours of Scotland (the regalia of crown, sword and sceptre) were used. However, with Cromwell's troops in Lothian, the honours could not be returned to Edinburgh. The Earl Marischal, as Marischal of Scotland, had formal responsibility for the honours,[29] and in June the Privy Council duly decided to place them at Dunnottar.[17] They were brought to the castle by Katherine Drummond, hidden in sacks of wool.[31] Sir George Ogilvie (or Ogilvy) of Barras was appointed lieutenant-governor of the castle, and given responsibility for its defence.[32]\nIn November 1651, Cromwell's troops called on Ogilvie to surrender, but he refused. During the subsequent blockade of the castle, the removal of the Honours of Scotland was planned by Elizabeth Douglas, wife of Sir George Ogilvie, and Christian Fletcher, wife of James Granger, minister of Kinneff Parish Church. The king's papers were first removed from the castle by Anne Lindsay, a kinswoman of Elizabeth Douglas, who walked through the besieging force with the papers sewn into her clothes.[31] Two stories exist regarding the removal of the honours themselves. Fletcher stated in 1664 that over the course of three visits to the castle in February and March 1652, she carried away the crown, sceptre, sword and sword case hidden amongst sacks of goods. Another account, given in the 18th century by a tutor to the Earl Marischal, records that the honours were lowered from the castle onto the beach, where they were collected by Fletcher's servant and carried off in a creel (basket) of seaweed. Having smuggled the honours from the castle, Fletcher and her husband buried them under the floor of the Old Kirk at Kinneff.[31]\nBy May 1652 the commander of the blockade, Colonel Thomas Morgan, had taken delivery of the artillery necessary for the reduction of Dunnottar.[32] Ogilvie surrendered on 24 May, on condition that the garrison could go free. Finding the honours gone, the Cromwellians imprisoned Ogilvie and his wife in the castle until the following year, when a false story was put about suggesting that the honours had been taken overseas.[32] Much of the castle property was removed, including twenty-one brass cannons,[33] and Marischal was required to sell further lands and possessions to pay fines imposed by Cromwell's government.[29]\nAt the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the honours were removed from Kinneff Church and returned to the king. Ogilvie quarrelled with Marischal's mother over who would take credit for saving the honours,[29] though he was eventually rewarded with a baronetcy. Fletcher was awarded 2,000 merks by Parliament but the sum was never paid.[31]\nWhigs and Jacobites\nDunnottar drawn by John Slezer in 1693\nReligious and political conflicts continued to be played out at Dunnottar through the 17th and early 18th centuries. In 1685, during the rebellion of the Earl of Argyll against the new king James VII, 167 Covenanters were seized and held in a cellar at Dunnottar. The prisoners included 122 men and 45 women associated with the Whigs, an anti-Royalist group within the Covenanter movement, and had refused to take an oath of allegiance to the new king.[34] The Whigs were imprisoned from May 24 until late July. A group of 25 escaped, although two of these were killed in a fall from the cliffs, and another 15 were recaptured.[35] Five prisoners died in the vault, and 37 of the Whigs were released after taking the oath of allegiance.[34] The remaining prisoners were transported to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, as part of a colonisation scheme devised by George Scot of Pitlochie. Many, like Scot himself, died on the voyage.[36] The cellar, located beneath the \"King's Bedroom\" in the 16th-century castle buildings, has since become known as the \"Whigs' Vault\".[34]\nBoth the Jacobites (supporters of the exiled Stuarts) and the Hanoverians (supporters of George I and his descendants) used Dunnottar Castle. In 1689, during Viscount Dundee's campaign in support of the deposed James VII, the castle was garrisoned for William III and Mary II with Lord Marischal appointed captain.[37] Seventeen suspected Jacobites from Aberdeen were seized and held in the fortress for around three weeks, including George Liddell, professor of mathematics at Marischal College.[38] In the Jacobite Rising of 1715 George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal, took an active role with the rebels, leading cavalry at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. After the subsequent abandonment of the rising Lord Marischal fled to the Continent, eventually becoming French ambassador for Frederick the Great of Prussia. Meanwhile, in 1716, his titles and estates including Dunnottar were declared forfeit to the crown.[39]\nLater history\nDunnottar Castle by James Cassie, 1857\nDunnottar Castle by Waller Hugh Paton, 1867\nThe seized estates of the Earl Marischal were purchased in 1720 for £41,172, by the York Buildings Company who dismantled much of the castle.[17] In 1761, the Earl briefly returned to Scotland and bought back Dunnottar only to sell it five years later to Alexander Keith (1736–1819),[40] an Edinburgh lawyer who served as Knight Marischal of Scotland.[17] Dunnottar was held by Alexander Keith and then his son, Sir Alexander Keith (1768–1832) before being inherited in 1852 by Sir Patrick Keith-Murray of Ochtertyre, who in turn sold it in July 1873 to Major Alexander Innes of Cowie and Raemoir for about £80,000.[41] It was purchased by Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, in 1925, after which his wife embarked on a programme of repairs.[34] Since that time, the castle has remained in the family, and has been open to the public, attracting 52,500 visitors in 2009,[42] and over 135,000 visitors in 2019.[43]\nDunnottar Castle, and the headland on which is stands, was designated as a Scheduled monument in 1970.[2]\nIn 1972, twelve of the structures at Dunnottar were listed.[3] Three buildings were listed at category A as being of \"national importance\": the keep;[44] the entrance gateway;[45] and Benholm's Lodging.[46] The remaining listings were at category B as being of \"regional importance\".[47] However, in 2018, the listed status for those buildings was removed as part of Historic Environment Scotland's \"Dual Designation 2A Project\".[44][45][48][46][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56]\nThe Hon. Charles Anthony Pearson, the younger son of the 3rd Viscount Cowdray, currently owns and runs Dunnottar Castle which is part of the 210-square-kilometre (81 sq mi) Dunecht Estates.[57] Portions of the 1990 film Hamlet, starring Mel Gibson and Glenn Close, were shot there.[58] In the Disney movie Brave, Dunnottar Castle was chosen for Merida's home.\nDescription\nPlan of Dunnottar Castle Key: A Gatehouse and Benholm's Lodging · B Tunnels · C Tower house · D Forge · E Waterton's Lodging · F Stables · G Palace · H Chapel · I Postern gate · J Whigs' Vault · K Bowling green · L Sentry box · M Cliffs · N North Sea\nDunnottar's strategic location allowed its owners to control the coastal terrace between the North Sea cliffs and the hills of the Mounth, 2+1⁄4 miles (3.6 km) inland, which enabled access to and from the north-east of Scotland.[59] The site is accessed via a steep, 2,600-foot (790 m) footpath (with modern staircases) from a car park on the coastal road, or via a 3-kilometre (2 mi) cliff-top path from Stonehaven.\nDunnottar's several buildings, put up between the 13th and 17th centuries, are arranged across a headland covering around 1.4 hectares (3+1⁄2 acres).[9] The dominant building, viewed from the land approach, is the 14th-century keep or tower house. The other principal buildings are the gatehouse; the chapel; and the 16th-century \"palace\" which incorporates the \"Whigs' Vault\".\nDefences\nThe gatehouse (centre) and Benholm's Lodging (left) seen from within the castle\nThe approach to the castle is overlooked by outworks on the \"Fiddle Head\", a promontory on the western side of the headland. The entrance is through the well-defended main gate, set in a curtain wall which entirely blocks a cleft in the rocky cliffs.[60] The gate has a portcullis and has been partly blocked up. Alongside the main gate is the 16th-century Benholm's Lodging, a five-storey building cut into the rock, which incorporated a prison with apartments above.[15] Three tiers of gun ports face outwards from the lower floors of Benholm's Lodging, while inside the main gate, a group of four gun ports face the entrance. The entrance passage then turns sharply to the left, running underground through two tunnels to emerge near the tower house.[9]\nSimpson contends that these defences are \"without exception the strongest in Scotland\",[61] although later writers have doubted the effectiveness of the gun ports. Cruden notes that the alignment of the gun ports in Benholm's Lodging, facing across the approach rather than along, means that they are of limited efficiency.[62] The practicality of the gun ports facing the entrance has also been questioned,[15] though an inventory of 1612 records that four brass cannons were placed here.[63]\nA second access to the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the aperture to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff-top, which in turn offers access to the castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward.[33] A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.[64]\nTower house and surrounding buildings\nThe tower house of Dunnottar, viewed from the west\nThe late 14th-century tower house has a stone-vaulted basement, and originally had three further storeys and a garret above.[4] Measuring 40 by 36 feet (12 by 11 m), the tower house stood 50 feet (15 m) high to its gable.[65] The principal rooms included a great hall and a private chamber for the lord, with bedrooms upstairs.[15] Beside the tower house is a storehouse, and a blacksmith's forge with a large chimney. A stable block is ranged along the southern edge of the headland. Nearby is Waterton's Lodging, also known as the Priest's House, built around 1574,[66] possibly for the use of William Keith (died 1580), son of the 4th Earl Marischal.[15] This small self-contained house includes a hall and kitchen at ground level, with private chambers above, and has a projecting spiral stair on the north side.[66] It is named for Thomas Forbes of Waterton, an attendant of the 7th Earl.[67]\nPalace\nThe palace, from the south-west, with the Silver House in the foreground, and the chapel on the right\nThe palace, to the north-east of the headland, was built in the late 16th century and early to mid-17th century. It comprises three main wings set out around a quadrangle, and for the most part is probably the work of the 5th Earl Marischal who succeeded in 1581.[nb 1] It provided extensive and comfortable accommodation to replace the rooms in the tower house. In its long, low design it has been compared to contemporary English buildings, in contrast to the Scottish tradition of taller towers still prevalent in the 16th century.[68]\nSeven identical lodgings are arranged along the west range, each opening onto the quadrangle and including windows and fireplaces. Above the lodgings of the west range comprised a 120-foot (37 m) gallery. Now roofless, the gallery originally had an elaborate oak ceiling, and on display was a Roman tablet taken from the Antonine Wall.[69][nb 2] At the north end of the gallery was a drawing room linked to the north range. The gallery could also be accessed from the Silver House to the south, which incorporated a broad stairway with a treasury above.[15]\nDunnottar castle viewed from above the entry path\nThe basement of the north range incorporates kitchens and stores, with a dining room and great chamber above. At ground floor level is the Water Gate, between the north and west ranges, which gives access to the postern on the northern cliffs.[70] The east and north ranges are linked via a rectangular stair. The east range has a larder, brewhouse and bakery at ground level, with a suite of apartments for the countess above. A north-east wing contains the Earl's apartments, and includes the \"King's Bedroom\" in which Charles II stayed. In this room is a carved stone inscribed with the arms of the 7th Earl and his wife, and the date 1645. Below these rooms is the Whigs' Vault, a cellar measuring 52 by 15 ft (15.8 by 4.6 m). This cellar, in which the Covenanters were held in 1685, has a large eastern window, as well as a lower vault accessed via a trapdoor in the floor.[71] Of the chambers in the palace, only the dining room and the Silver House remain roofed, having been restored in the 1920s.\nThe central area contains a circular cistern or fish pond, 50 ft (15 m) across and 25 ft (7.6 m) deep,[72] and a bowling green is located to the west.[4] At the south-east corner of the quadrangle is the chapel, consecrated in 1276 and largely rebuilt in the 16th century. Medieval walling and two 13th-century windows remain, and there is a graveyard to the south.[9][15] Dunnottar Castle\nSee also\nDunnottar Parish Church\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAlcock, Leslie; Alcock, Elizabeth A (1992). \"Reconnaissance excavations on Early Historic fortifications and other royal sites in Scotland, 1974–84; 5: A, Excavations & other fieldwork at Forteviot, Perthshire, 1981; B, Excavations at Urquhart Castle, Inverness-shire, 1983; C, Excavations at Dunnottar, Kincardineshire, 1984\" (PDF).

    "text": "Castle on the coast of Banff and Buchan, Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nFindlater Castle.\nclass=notpageimage| Findlater Castle shown within the United Kingdom(grid reference NJ541672)\nFindlater Castle is the old seat of the Earls of Findlater and Seafield, sitting on a 50-foot (15 m)-high cliff overlooking the Moray Firth on the coast of Banff and Buchan, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nLocation and etymology\nIt lies about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Banff, near the village of Sandend, between Cullen and Portsoy. The cliffs here contain quartz; the name \"Findlater\" is derived from the Scots Gaelic words fionn (\"white\") and leitir (\"cliff or steep slope\").\nHistory\nThe first historical reference to the castle is from 1246. King Alexander III of Scotland repaired this castle in the 1260s in preparation for an invasion by King Haakon IV of Norway. The Norwegians took and held the castle for some time. The castle remains that are still there are from the 14th-century rebuilding, when the castle was redesigned based on the Roslyn Castle model.\nJames V of Scotland visited Findlater in November 1535 after a pilgrimage to Tain.[1] The Laird of Findlater, an Ogilvy, was Master of Household to Mary of Guise. He lost his inheritance following sexual misconduct with his mother-in-law and making a plan to imprison his father in a cellar to deprive him of sleep and drive him insane to obtain his lands. After his father's death his mother married John Gordon, a son of the Earl of Huntly, who then took possession of the castle and lands, and promptly imprisoned her.[2]\nJohn Gordon, now of Findlater, fought with Lord Ogilvy in July 1562 and injured his arm.[3] Gordon was imprisoned in Edinburgh until his victim healed, according to custom.[4] In September 1562 Mary, Queen of Scots sent an army equipped with artillery from Dunbar Castle to besiege Findlater, and eject John Gordon of Findlater.[5] When Mary was nearby on 20 September, she had sent her trumpeter messenger to deliver the castle to the captain of her guard, but he was refused.[6] In October 1562 the Earl of Huntly sent Mary the keys of Findlater and Auchindoun, but she was suspicious of the low status of the messenger.[7]\nJames Ogilvy, 1st Earl of Findlater, was given the earldom in 1638. He built the nearby Cullen House to take the place of the castle as the family seat and by the time he died in 1653 it was little used and in decline.\nConservation\nThe castle is a scheduled monument.[8]\nReferences\nExternal links\nFindlater family site\nPortsoy poets site\nTake a 360 Virtual Tour of Findlater Castle\n57°41′32.60″N 2°46′13.47″W / 57.6923889°N 2.7704083°W / 57.6923889; -2.7704083\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nLocation of Fyvie Castle within the former Grampian region\nFyvie Castle - painting by James Giles\nFyvie Castle is a castle in the village of Fyvie, near Turriff in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nHistory\nThe earliest parts of Fyvie Castle date from the 13th century – some sources claim it was built in 1211 by William the Lion. Fyvie was the site of an open-air court held by Robert the Bruce, and Charles I lived there as a child for 4 years. Following the Battle of Otterburn in 1388, it ceased to be a royal stronghold as it was passed to Henry Preston as a reward from Robert iii.[clarification needed]. Instead, it fell into the possession of five successive families – Preston, Meldrum, Seton, Gordon and Forbes-Leith – each of whom added a new tower to the castle. The oldest of these, the Preston Tower (located on the far right as one faces the main facade of Fyvie), dates to between 1390 and 1433. The impressive Seton tower forms the entrance, and was erected in 1599 by Alexander Seton. He commissioned the great wheel staircase several years later. The Gordon Tower followed in 1777, and the Leith in 1890.\nInside, the castle stronghold features a great wheel stair, a display of original arms and armour, and a collection of portraits, from artists such as Henry Raeburn, Pompeo Batoni and Thomas Gainsborough.\nManus O'Cahan and Montrose fought a successful minor battle against the Covenant Army at Fyvie Castle on 28 October 1644. The battlefield was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland in 2011.[1] Anne Halkett stayed at the castle from 1650 to 1652 with the Countess of Dunfermline, she treated wounded soldiers and the illnesses of local people, and negotiated with the English major of a company of Commonwealth soldiers, and with three Colonels, Lilburne, Fitts, and Overton.[2]\nThe grounds and adjoining Fyvie Lake were landscaped in the 18th century by Col. William Gordon. The Scottish industrialist Alexander Leith (later Baron Leith of Fyvie) bought the castle in 1885. His descendants sold it to the National Trust for Scotland in 1984.\nTo the east there is a walled garden where Scottish fruits are currently cultivated.[3] There is evidence for two other walled gardens closer to the castle itself to its west and south.[4] The one to the west appears on an estate plan of 1768.[5]\nGhostlore\nThe castle (like many places in Scotland) has ghostlore associated with it.[6] A story is told that in 1920 during renovation work the skeleton of a woman was discovered behind a bedroom wall. On the day the remains were laid to rest in Fyvie cemetery, the castle residents started to be plagued by strange noises and unexplained happenings. Fearing he had offended the dead woman, the Laird of the castle had the skeleton exhumed and replaced behind the bedroom wall, at which point the haunting ceased. It is said that there is a secret room in the south-west corner of the castle that must remain sealed lest anyone entering meet with disaster.[7] It is unclear if this is the same room in which the skeleton was found. There is also an indelible blood stain, two ghosts and two curses associated with this place.[8]\nOne of the curses has been attributed to the prophetic laird, Thomas the Rhymer. The curse is said to have been part of the mysterious three weeping stones. The curse decrees that until all three stones taken from the castle's boundary marks are brought together, the firstborn sons of the families who live at Fyvie will never inherit the castle. Only one weeping stone is known to exist and is kept at the castle. The other two have never been found, with one built into the castle walls and the other in the depths of the river Ythan. The second curse involves a hidden room in the charter room. The curse is very specific: death to the lord of the castle and blindness to his wife if anyone disturbs it.\nIn the media\nFyvie Castle has featured in a number of British television programmes, such as Living TV's Most Haunted series 6[9] and STV's Castles of Scotland.\nThe castle also played host of the setting of a children's gameshow on CBBC called Spook Squad in 2004.\n2009 saw the publication of the children's fantasy novel, The Time-Tailor and the Fyvie Castle Witch Trials, written by Deborah Leslie. The castle was also featured in the BBC documentary Castle Ghosts of Scotland,[10] narrated by Robert Hardy. In recent years, the castle grounds have hosted a Fyvie Live music festival in the summer, which was headlined in 2011 by Beverley Knight and in 2012 by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, then following a gap of several years, by The Shires in 2017. Following the revival, it was announced that the event would take place again in 2018, with Ward Thomas as the headline act. in August 2024 it also hosted re-enactors from all over the country to bring a re-enactment of the battle of Fyvie 1644.\nToday, the castle is open to tourists between April and October. It is also a wedding venue.\nSide view of the castle\nReferences\nExternal links\nFyvie Castle – National Trust for Scotland\nFyvie Castle Grounds Virtual Tour\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

Before her defeat of the Gordons at the Battle of Corrichie in October 1562, Mary, Queen of Scots stayed here.[1]\nThe castle ruins were demolished in 1975,[1] with the last remains removed by 1982.[2]\nStructure\nThere is no longer any trace of the castle, which had a keep.[1] In 1780 it was reported to Thomas Pennant that the castle was “an old building,.., placed on a small mount, and surrounded with a deep ditch. It is a square tower; one end of it is fallen down, and shews a section of strong vaulted rooms; but there seemed nothing so singular in its structure, as to merit more particular attention”.[2]\nGartly Castle was constructed on a natural mound about 17 metres (56 ft) across and up to 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) high. There was a ditch to the south, east and west.[3]\nCastles in Great Britain and Ireland\nList of castles in Scotland\nReferences\n^ a b c d Coventry, Martin (1997) The Castles of Scotland.

    "text": "Ruined castle in Scotland\nFor HM Castle Huntly, a 15th-century castle west of Dundee that is now used as a prison, see Castle Huntly.\nHuntly Castle is a ruined castle north of Huntly in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where the rivers Deveron and Bogie meet.[1] It was the ancestral home of the chief of Clan Gordon, Earl of Huntly. There have been four castles built on the site that have been referred to as Huntly Castle, Strathbogie Castle or Peel of Strathbogie.[1][2]\nLocation\nHuntly Castle was built on the crossing of the rivers Deveron and Bogie, north of Huntly and roughly 40 miles from Aberdeen. The original wooden castle was built on a motte. The second castle, made of stone, was built on the northern end of the bailey. The third and modern castles were built to the east of the original, at the southern end of the estate.[2]\nHistory\nThe castle was originally built by Duncan II, Earl of Fife, on the Strathbogie estate sometime around 1180 and 1190.[2][1] The castle became known as the Peel of Strathbogie.[3]\nThe Earl Duncan's third son, David, inherited the Strathbogie estate and later, through marriage, became earls of Atholl around 1204.[1] During the Strathbogie family's time at the estate, Robert the Bruce was a guest after falling ill at Inverurie. The family was loyal to him and when he got better, Robert the Bruce went on to win the battle of Bannockburn.[3] However, around 1314, David of Strathbogie shifted his support to the English right before Robert the Bruce won the battle of Bannockburn. Robert the Bruce saw this as treachery and granted the castle and estate to Sir Adam Gordon of Huntly because he was consistently loyal. In 1506, the castle was officially renamed Huntly Castle.[2]\nReign of James IV\nAlthough the castle was burned to the ground, a grander castle was built in its place. In 1496, the pretender to the English throne, Perkin Warbeck, was married to Lady Catherine Gordon the daughter of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, witnessed by King James IV of Scotland at Edinburgh. James IV came to Huntly in October 1501 and gave gifts of money to the stonemasons working on the castle. In October 1503, James IV came again and played in a shooting contest at a target called a \"prop\".[4] He came back again in the following October, on his way south, accompanied by four Italian minstrels and an African drummer known as the \"More taubronar\".[5] James IV played cards at the castle on 10 October 1505 and gave a tip to masons working on the building. These visits were part of his annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Duthac at Tain.[6] Architecturally the L plan castle consists of a well-preserved five-story tower with an adjoining great hall and supporting buildings. Areas of the original ornate facade and interior stonework remain. Wings were added to the castle in the 16th and 17th centuries.\nCarved inscriptions feature on the facade\nReign of Mary, Queen of Scots\nWilliam Mackintosh was executed on 23 August 1550 at \"Castle Strathbogie\", as a conspirator against the Earl of Huntly, the queen's lieutenant in the North.[7]\nThe English diplomat Thomas Randolph stayed two nights in September 1562,[8] and wrote that the castle was \"fayer, beste furnishede of anye howse that I have seen in thys countrie.\"[9] Mary, Queen of Scots decided to take the castle, giving as a cause that the Earl withheld from her a royal cannon lent to him by Regent Arran.[10] She sent her half-brother John Stewart, Commendator of Coldingham to arrest the George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly at Huntly Castle in October 1562. On the day William Kirkcaldy of Grange and the Tutor of Pitcur arrived first and surrounded the house. While Kirkcaldy was talking to the castle porter, the castle watchman on the tower spotted Coldingham and the Master of Lindsay and their troops a mile off. He alerted the Earl, who ran without \"boot or sword\" and hopped over a low wall at the back of the castle and found a horse before Pitcur could stop him. Elizabeth Keith, Countess of Huntly then welcomed the queen's men and gave them a meal and showed them around the place. She still had her chapel furnished for Roman Catholic worship.[11]\nGeorge Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly died after the Battle of Corrichie on 28 October 1562, and the castle was garrisoned for Mary, Queen of Scots by Charles Crawfurd and twenty soldiers. Furnishings including beds and 45 tapestries were carted to Aberdeen and shipped in barrels to Edinburgh for the royal collection and refurbishment by Servais de Condé.[12] After the surrender of Mary, Queen of Scots, at the battle of Carberry Hill, the Earl of Bothwell came north to meet George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly at \"Stawboggye\", and moved on to Spynie Castle after Huntly deserted his cause.[13] In July 1570 the exiled Earl of Westmorland found refuge at Huntly.[14]\nJohn Gordon, Earl of Sutheerland\nJohn Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland and his wife Marion Seton were poisoned at Helmsdale Castle in 1567 by Isobel Sinclair, the wife of Gordon of Gartly.[15] Isobel Seton's own son also died, but the fifteen-year-old heir of Sutherland, Alexander Gordon was unharmed. He was made to marry the Earl of Caithness' daughter Barbara Sinclair. In 1569 he escaped from the Sinclairs to Huntly Castle and remained at Huntly until he came of age in 1573. Barbara Sinclair died, and Alexander Gordon, now Earl of Sutherland, married Jean Gordon, former wife of the Earl of Bothwell, who had also found a refuge at Huntly Castle.[16]\nA fatal football match\nAn early description of the death of George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly in 1576, compiled by Richard Bannatyne gives some details of how the castle was used.[17] The Earl suffered a stroke, or a collapse caused by food poisoning, while playing football outside the Castle on the Green. He was taken through the outer gate to his bedchamber in the round tower of the palace block, which was then called the \"New Warke of Strathbogie.\" The Earl's bedchamber was adjacent to his \"Grit Chalmer\", the Great Chamber. After the Earl died, his body was laid out in the \"Chamber of Dais\", another name for the Great Chamber, and his valuables were secured in the bedchamber. After the Earl's steward left the castle, a number of alleged supernatural events occurred beginning with the sudden collapse of one of the servants in the \"Laich Chalmer\", Low Chamber. This \"Laich Chalmer\" was in another part of the castle, under a stair opposite the \"Auld Hall.\" On the following day, a servant went up to the Gallery at the top of the \"New Warke\" where spices (which were precious) were stored. This servant and two companions also collapsed and when revived complained of feeling cold. After the Earl's body was embalmed and taken to the chapel, his brother sat on a bench in the Hall by the Great Chamber door, and heard unexplained sounds from the chamber. It was said that \"there is not a live thing bigger than a mouse may enter in that chamber with the door locked.\"[18]\nEngraving of the castle by James Fittler in Scotia Depicta, published 1804\nRear courtyard ruins of Huntly Castle\nJames VI slights the castle\nIn March 1584 an English recusant Catholic Sir Thomas Gerard of Bryn was sent by Lady Ferniehirst to find refuge at Huntly.[19] George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly was a Catholic and James VI decided to subdue his power in the north. The king arrived at Huntly on 26 April 1589 after spending a night at Kintore. The Earl of Huntly had fled to the mountains, stripping the countryside and emptying the house of furniture. James brought 100 workmen to demolish the castle. Huntly sent the king an offer to spare the house and surrendered.[20]\nIn March 1593 a royal garrison of 16 men commanded by Archie Carmichael was to be put in Huntly Castle.[21] In May 1593 the Earl captured a man called Pedder in the lands of Atholl. Pedder was hanged and dismembered and his body parts displayed on poles at Huntly.[22]\nIn July 1594 Huntly was overseeing the building of a new hall and gallery.[23] Following the battle of Glenlivet, James VI came with workmen again and his master of works William Schaw, and planned to blow up the \"gret old tower\" which had been \"fourteen years in building\" on 29 October 1594.[24] The kirk minister Andrew Melville was with the king and a vocal advocate for demolition.[25] Aberdeen town council bought twenty stones in weight of gunpowder for the demolition of Huntly and other places,[26] and sent the stonemason John Fraser and other workmen to the demolition work at Huntly and Old Slains Castle, equipped with new shovels.[27]\nThe royal council met at Terrisoule to discuss the planned demolition on 28 October. Some Lords wanted the fortress kept to hold a loyal garrison. James VI still wished the whole castle, the new and old work, to be slighted.[28] It was decided not to completely demolish Huntly and Slains Castle and other houses, but preserve them for the convenience of the royal garrisons. It was also said that the pleas of the Countesses of Huntly and Erroll to save the houses were successful.[29] David Foulis wrote to Anthony Bacon that Henrietta Stewart, Countess of Huntly, watched the demolition at Huntly and was not allowed to have an audience with the king to plead her case.[30] The king made his friend Sir John Gordon of Pitlurg the keeper of the remaining buildings at Huntly.[31]\nRestored for a Marquess\nThe Marquess of Huntly restored and rebuilt the castle.[32] In 1746, an English soldier, James Ray, saw the ruins and commented on ceilings, still decorated with \"history-painting\".[33]\nHuntly spent large sums restoring and enlarging the castle in April 1597.[34] The restored facade of the main block was carved with the names and titles of the marquess, \"George Gordon\" and his wife, \"Henrietta Stewart\" who was a favourite of the queen, Anne of Denmark.[35] In February 1603 James VI made plans to resolve the Marquess's feuds including a royal visit to Huntly with Anne of Denmark and the Earl of Moray later in the year. The visit did not take place because of the death of Elizabeth I and the subsequent Union of the Crowns.[36]\nIn 1640 the Castle was occupied by the Scottish Covenanter army under Major-General Robert Monro (d. 1680). James Gordon Parson of Rothiemay tells us how the house \"was preserved from being rifled or defaced, except some emblems and imagery, which looked somewhat popish and superstitious lycke; and therefore, by the industry of one captain James Wallace (one of Munro's foote captaines) were hewd and brocke doune off the frontispiece of the house; but all the rest of the frontispiece containing Huntly's scutcheon, etc, was left untouched, as it stands to this daye.\"\nCaptured in October 1644, the castle was briefly held by James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose against the Duke of Argyll. In 1647 it was gallantly defended against General David Leslie by Lord Charles Gordon, but its 'Irish' garrison was starved into surrender. Savage treatment was meted out, for the men were hanged and their officers beheaded. In December of the same year the Marquess of Huntly himself was captured and on his way to execution at Edinburgh was detained, by a refinement of cruelty, in his own mansion. His escort was shot against its walls.\nAn inventory made by the garrison shows the state rooms were still fully furnished, including the earl's 'chapel bed'.[37] In 1650 Charles II visited briefly on his way to the Battle of Worcester, defeat and exile. The Civil War brought an end to the Gordon of Huntly family's long occupation of the castle.\nIn 1689, during the first Jacobite rising, the castle was briefly the headquarters for Viscount Dundee and his Jacobite army, at the end of April, just after the start of the revolt. However, by the early eighteenth century the castle was already in decay and providing material for predatory house builders in the village. In 1746, during a later Jacobite rising, it was occupied by British government troops. Thereafter, it became a common quarry until a groundswell of antiquarian sentiment in the 19th century came to the rescue of the noble pile.\nHuntly Castle remained under the ownership of the Clan Gordon until 1923. Today, the remains of the castle are cared for by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.[38]\nPure Strength I, a major international strongman competition, was held on the grounds of Huntly Castle in 1987. The winner of the contest was Jón Páll Sigmarsson of Iceland.[39]\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"History\". www.historicenvironment.scot.

    "text": "Ruined castle in Kildrummy, Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nKildrummy Castle is a ruined castle near Kildrummy, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Though ruined, it is one of the most extensive castles dating from the 13th century to survive in eastern Scotland, and was the seat of the Earls of Mar. It is owned today by Historic Environment Scotland and is open to the public as a scheduled ancient monument[1] with gardens that are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.[2]\nHistory\nThe castle was probably built in the mid-13th century under Gilbert de Moravia. It has been posited that siting of Kildrummy Castle was influenced by the location of the Grampian Mounth trackway crossings, particularly the Elsick Mounth and Cryne Corse Mounth.[3] Kildrummy Castle underwent siege numerous times in its history, first in defence of the family of Robert the Bruce in August–September 1306 (leading to the executions of Nigel Bruce and many other Scots),[4] and again in 1335 by David of Strathbogie. On this occasion Christina Bruce held off the attackers until her husband Sir Andrew Murray came to her rescue.[5] In the reign of David II, Walter Maule of Panmure was warden of Kildrummy Castle.[6]\nIn 1403-4 Alexander Stewart, murdered Sir Malcolm Drummond and then took his widow, Isabel Douglas, Countess of Mar, by force and laid claim to Kildrummy and the title of \"Earl of Mar\". In 1435 it was taken over by James I and became a royal castle. In 1468 Henry Kinghorn was keeper of Kildrummy Castle for James III and spent £100 Scots on building works and repairs.[7] James IV granted the keeping of Kildrummy and its lands to Alexander Elphinstone, 1st Lord Elphinstone and his wife Elizabeth Barlow in 1507.[8]\nThe castle passed from the Clan Elphinstone to the Clan Erskine before being abandoned in 1716 following the failure of the Jacobite Rising of 1715.\nIn 1538 the castle was raided by John Strachan, the young laird of Lenturk, who took furnishings and fixtures. Strachan brought a blacksmith to remove the ironwork from the windows and doors. Some of the metal was turned into horseshoes and used to mend ploughs at the Kirktoun of Glenbuchat.[9]\nIn May 1585 Margaret Haldane, the wife of David Erskine, Commendator of Dryburgh, was held at Kildrummy in the custody of the Master of Elphinstone.[10] In 1645 Robert Farquharson of Invercauld was the keeper of Kildrummy Castle for the Earl of Mar and his son Lord Erskine. The laird of Glenkindie also helped to keep the castle, fearing the depredations that a garrison of outsider or \"stranger\" soldiers would make on his lands.[11]\nArchitecture\nKildrummy Castle is \"shield-shaped\" in plan with a number of independent towers. The flat side of the castle overlooks a steep ravine; moreover, on the opposite side of the castle the walls come to a point, which was once defended by a massive twin-towered gatehouse. The castle also had a keep, called the Snow Tower, taller than the other towers, built in the French style, as at Bothwell Castle. Extensive earthworks protected the castle, including a dry moat and the ravine. Most of the castle foundations are now visible, along with most of its lower-storey walls.

    "text": "Historic baronial fortress\nLauriston Castle stands on a clifftop site near the Aberdeenshire village of St Cyrus and just over a mile inland from the North Sea coast of Scotland. Once a royal fortress, it can claim to be one of the oldest privately owned and inhabited castles in the region. It is a Category C listed building.[1]\nHistory\n9th century\nBy tradition, it was the stronghold of Giric, Grig or Gregory the Great, one of the last of the Pictish kings (AD 878–889). The site of his church of Ecclesgreig (Eglise Grig) is nearby and he gave his Latin name, Ciricius, to St. Cyrus.[2]\n13th – 17th centuries\nLauriston’s first charter is dated 1243 and it soon developed into a classic courtyard castle which was savagely fought over during Scotland's Wars of Independence and strengthened by King Edward III in 1336 as part of the chain of strongholds which he hoped would prevent a French landing in support of the Scots.\nOne of the corner towers on the edge of the cliff was incorporated into a typical laird’s house in the 1500s. In turn, this house was absorbed into a very large Georgian mansion of Palladian design, dated 1765–89.\nFor nearly 450 years Lauriston was held by the Stratons, whose arms of 1292 are among the earliest recorded in Scotland.[3] The eloquent Declaration of Arbroath, the famous letter of 1320 to Pope John XXII, sealed by the nation’s earls and barons, has as its final signatory the name of Alexander Straton.\nAnother Straton, the “noble knicht o’ Lauriston”, fell at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, and shortly afterwards his son was involved in the affair of the Sheriff’s Kettle. The barons of the Mearns had been complaining about the high-handed behaviour of John Melville of Glenbervie, Sheriff of Kincardineshire, and King James’s Regent, the Duke of Albany, exclaimed in exasperation that he would not mind if they \"biled the loon and suppit the bree\". Taking this as royal licence, a group of barons lured Melville to a hunting party, tipped him into a cauldron or kettle of boiling water and, to seal the conspiracy, supped the broth.[4]\nThe Stratons continued, however, to prosper at Lauriston, even surviving the events of 1534, when David Straton fell out with the Church over payment of tithes on the salmon fishery. He objected to giving every tenth fish to the Abbot of Arbroath and told “his servants to cast the tenth fish into the sea againe\", saying that God could catch his own. For this evasion of Church taxes he was taken to Edinburgh and condemned to death, thus becoming one of Scotland's first Protestant martyrs.[5]\n17th – 18th centuries\nIn 1695, the Stratons were forced to sell Lauriston. Under the charter to the new owner, Court of Session Judge, Sir James Falconer of Phesdo, the estate became a burgh of barony, with a freeport at Miltonhaven.[6][7] The name of the barony was also changed to Miltonhaven, but storms in the 1790s swept away both the port and village, leaving Lauriston to be known as “The Drown’d Barony”. Over the following century, the policies were developed in fashionable Picturesque style, with waterfalls, walks and a two-acre walled garden.\n20th century\nFollowing its use as RAF barracks during World War II, part of the mansion was demolished, and according to Nigel Tranter, the castle had “fallen on evil days indeed”.[8][9]\nLauriston's Great Hall and Doocot Tower were rebuilt in the late 1980s by William and Dorothy Newlands of Lauriston to plans drawn up by architect Ian Begg.[10] The doocot received a Glenfiddich Living Scotland Award in 1992.\nLady Lauriston is chair of the Scottish Castles Association.\nReferences\n56°47′23″N 2°23′44″W / 56.7896°N 2.3955°W / 56.7896; -2.3955\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Old medieval Scottish castle\nFor Craighall Castle, the castle of Clan Rattray, see Blairgowrie and Rattray.\nCastle Hill in 2008, all that is left of the original site\nRattray Castle, one of the nine castles of the Knuckle The Castle of Rattray was a medieval Scottish castle, with multiple variations on its structure over approximately six centuries. Originally built as a \"late 12th- or early 13th century defensive motte\"[1] it provided protection for Starny Keppie Harbour and Rattray village. Sometime between 1214 and 1233 it was upgraded by William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan before being destroyed in the 1308 Harrying of Buchan. After Comyn's timber castle was burned down, it was replaced by a stronger stone castle which was engulfed during a 1720 sand storm along with nearby Rattray village. After the storm, the castle was not dug out and remains covered to this day. The castle was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of north-east Aberdeenshire.[2]\nLocation\nThe castle was sited on Castlehill, on the south bank of the now-closed estuary flowing into Strathbeg Bay- the north bank was protected by the opposite Lonmay Castle.[3] Specifically the castle was \"beside an inlet which led from the sea into a sheltered harbour\"[4] on \"the harbour side\" of Rattray village.[3] The later stone castle is known to have had a \"harbour-side entrance\".[5]\nOriginally situated on \"a rock near the sea\",[6][7] Castlehill is today about 1 mile inland as shifting sands have significantly altered the shape of the coast. Located to the south of Loch Strathbeg it can be seen as a grassy \"circular mound\"[8] which is \"oval & natural with its top slightly dished\".[5] A 1791 book states it has a \"summit\"... [of] \"half a Scots acre\"[9] (approx. 0.25 hectare) and \"rises 38 feet\"... (11.6 metres) \"above a small plain on the\"... north-east \"but is only 12 or 14 feet\"... (3.7 or 4.3 metres) \"above the higher ground\"[10] to the south-west.\nHistory\n1100 AD to 1200\nThe first construction of Castlehill was a small keep during the late middle ages, or a 12th century \"timber castle or Motte\"[4] built to protect the estuary.\nComyn period (1200 to 1308)\nIn the 13th century, the Castle of Rattray was \"the principal seat of the Cummings\"... [alt. spelling of Comyn] \"Earls of Buchan\"[11] who arrived at the start of that century. Between 1214 when he inherited the Earldom of Buchan and his own death in 1233, William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan[7][8] built upon the motte but it is unclear whether he upgraded the existing buildings or built an entirely new castle. He is known to have completed a \"manor house\"[4] with \"a fine timber-framed hall\"[4] (the castle) which was accompanied by the private St Mary's Chapel which he constructed \"a quarter of a mile\"[10] (0.4 kilometres) south, in Rattray village itself.\nIn the mid-1270s, it is reported that \"a castle-strengthening programme Rattray\"[12] took place.\nComyn's castle survived until the Harrying of Buchan in the summer of 1308,[6] when all the Comyn lands were bloodily burned to the ground after John Comyn, Earl of Buchan was beaten at the Battle of Barra. The timber Rattray Castle was almost certainly attacked by Robert the Bruce or his younger brother Edward after which the \"castle fell into ruins\"[10] if not burned to the ground.\n1308 to ~1720\nFollowing the harrying, the site of Rattray's timber castle was rebuilt with a \"stone-built hall\".[4] This stone incarnation provided protection for Starnie Keppie Harbour and the village of Rattray, as the previous incarnations did.\nThe Earldom of Buchan and hence the castle was inherited and divided after the harrying between John Comyn's two nieces.[13] Henry de Beaumont, the husband of one niece; Alice Comyn, claimed the title under her name but was disinherited from the lands in 1314. A 1324 charter from Robert the Bruce then gives the \"lordship of Rattray\" to Sir Archibald Douglas.[14] The lands again change hands in 1382 when Alexander Stewart was given the Earldom by his father Robert II of Scotland.\nMary, Queen of Scots, declared Rattray a Royal Burgh in 1563 \"to put an end to the disputes about superiority over it between William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal and George Hay, 7th Earl of Erroll\".[7] The importance of the Burgh is questionable due to the fact \"it does not appear to have long enjoyed that privilege not being ranked in the roll of boroughs for many ages\" [15] and as it was \"said to have had all the privileges of a royal borough, except sending members to parliament.\"[16]\nIn later years Rattray was run by a feudal system of superiors who maintained the land for the Crown, some of whom are known due to charters that they granted. \"David Rivis\"... \"superior of the lands of Rattray\"[17] granted a charter in 1617; \"William Watson of Haddo, bailie of the burgh of Rattray, superior\"[17] [of Rattray] granted a charter in 1675 and \"Charles\".. [Hay, 13th] \"Earl of Erroll, superior of the lands of Rattray\"[17] granted a charter in 1711.\nThe destruction of the stone castle and the nearby village of Rattray, is said by \"a tradition\"[7] to have happened during the great storm of 1720[18] which cut off Strathbeg Bay. It is believed that the castle was \"blown over with sand one Sunday evening while the\"[7] inhabitants, \"a godless crew\".[18] \"were engaged in playing cards\".[7] \"on the Sabbath, [when] they were buried alive.\"[18]\nAnother story says that the site was \"buried because of the plague.\"[7] However there is no date or record of which plague and it is a very unlikely account.\n~1720 to 1988\nToday there is not much to be seen at the site as the remains have \"for a long period [been] covered with a deep soil, and now- the swords of the warlike house beaten literally into ploughshares\".[19] In c. 1730, a dig at the south-east \"side of the Castle Hill\"... \"found a great number of stones, supposed to belong to the kitchen of the castle, as\"... \"workmen found very large hearthstones covered with ashes.\"[20]\nItems recovered include; \"a quantity of regularly-laid stones were removed c. 1734 and some silver coins\"[5] as well as two kilns stands found in 1829 (today held in Marischal Museum, Aberdeen).[21]\nIn 1740 \"a man who drove his spade through the panel of a door was immediately suffocated\"[7] having got caught in the sand and at an unknown date, a \"well-made causeway was discovered at the foot of the mound under which the Castle is said to be buried.\"[7]\n1985-1989 Excavations\nThorough excavations at Castlehill in 1985-1989 revealed the remains of the stone castle and traces of the previous timber one.[5] Traces of the stone castle revealed a \"perimeter wall\".. and \"two mural buildings\".[5] It also ascertained that the later stone castle was approximately \"20m by 6.5 m\"[5] and \"divided into three parts, a central room, and two smaller end rooms\".[5] It likely supported more than one storey, due to the \"indication of a possible forestair\"... and \"the wall thickness.\"[5]\nThe results of this excavation can be found in the Journal article (available free from the link in the journal citation below) \"Excavations at Rattray, Aberdeenshire.

    "text": "Historic site\nSlains Castle (otherwise known as Old Slains Castle) is a ruined castle near Collieston in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is not to be confused with New Slains Castle, a separate building located five miles (eight kilometres) northeast. Built in the 13th century, it was partly destroyed in 1594.\nHistory\nThe 13th-century castle was originally the property of the Comyn, Earl of Buchan. After the forfeiture of the Comyns in the 14th century it was given to Sir Gilbert Hay by Robert the Bruce in recognition for his support against the English.[1]\nSlains Castle next comes into prominence when Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll took part in a Catholic Rebellion in the north of Scotland. King James VI came to Abedeen in April 1589 and placed a garrison of soldiers at Slains Castle.[2] In January 1593, the Earl of Erroll was said to have welcomed so many English and Scottish Catholics in a tower at Slains that he was put to great expense.[3] The rebellion culminated in the Battle of Glenlivet in 1594, which left the Catholic army substantially weakened, and the rebellion collapsed. James VI marched north with an army intent on capturing the leaders of the rebellion, including Francis Hay, however they evaded capture.[4] He then proceeded to blow up their castles, including Old Slains Castle. At the king's request, Aberdeen Council provided 20 stone (130 kilograms) weight of gunpowder together with pickaxes and other tools, required for ‘demolishing and casting down of houses and fortalices to the sum of 548 pounds six shillings’.[5] The castle was destroyed with gunpowder and cannon on 1 November.[6] Aberdeen town council sent the stonemason John Fraser and other workmen to the demolition work at Huntly Castle and Slains, equipped with new shovels.[7] Two walls meeting at a corner survived the explosion. (Old) Slains Castle. What remains after it was blown up with gunpowder in 1594. Next year, Elizabeth Douglas, Countess of Erroll, a friend of Anne of Denmark, hired masons to repair the building.[8] However, it was beyond saving. She then moved into the farmhouse of Clochtow, 1⁄2 mile (800 metres) northwest of the ruined castle. She remained in this ‘mean abode, and continued there sometime after 1597, when the honours and estates were restored... The Countess, all her remaining days, preferred to her noble title of Countess of Erroll the plain designation of “Guidwife of Clochtow”, because this designation had never been taken by the crown from her, and she had been known by it during the period of her husband’s exile, when he was a wanderer abroad, and only plain “Francis Hay”.’[9] Francis Hay later built a tower house called Bowness on what is now the site of New Slains Castle.[10]\nStructure\nOriginally a strongly built 5-storey oblong keep (of which a small part remains), a wall defending the landward side was added in the early 16th century.\nModern day\nTwo sections of wall remain standing, at approximately 25 metres (82 ft) in height. The south-facing wall partially collapsed on 31 May 1979. An estimated 100 tons of rubble fell on the road next to the castle, blocking the road and partially burying a lorry.[11] In the 1950s, a 3-storey house was built within the ruins, adjoining a fishing cottage built in the 18th century. Since 1991 several archaeological excavations have been carried out, the last one in 2007.[1][citation needed] The remains of the old castle are designated as a scheduled ancient monument.[1]\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAitken, Margaret.

    "text": "Former castle near Helensburgh\nArdencaple Castle, also known as Ardincaple Castle, and sometimes referred to as Ardencaple Castle Light, is a listed building, situated about 1 statute mile (1.6 km) from Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, Scotland.[2][3] Today, all that remains of the castle is a tower, perched on the edge of a plateau, looking down on a flat tract of land between it and the shore of the Firth of Clyde.[4] The original castle was thought to have been built sometime in the 12th century,[5] and part of the remains of the original castle were said to have existed in the 19th century.[2] Today, that sole remaining tower is used as a navigational aid for shipping on the Firth of Clyde. Because of its use as a lighthouse the tower has been called Ardencaple Castle Light.[6]\nLairds of Ardincaple\nThe word Ardencaple or Ardincaple has been said to be derived from the Gaelic Ard na gCapull, meaning \"cape of the horses\", or \"of the mares\", or \"height of the horses\".[7][8] In 1351 this place name was recorded as Airdendgappil.[7] From the Middle Ages the lands of Ardencaple were controlled by the Lairds of Ardincaple. By the late 15th century or 16th century the lairds had adopted the surname MacAulay. By this time the Laird of Ardincaple was considered the clan chief of Clan MacAulay.\nThe fortunes of the Lairds of Ardincaple failed in the 18th century, and they were forced to divide and sell, piece by piece, the lands of Ardincaple and their other estates to pay debts. Archibald MacAulay, 9th laird (died 1752), began the process around 1700,[9] and the sales continued under his sons - one of whom wrote a primer on shorthand in an effort to raise money.[10] By the time the 12th laird died around 1767, the roof had fallen in and the overall condition of the castle had deteriorated to such an extent that he had been forced to abandon his residence there and live in nearby Laggarie, having completed the sale of the MacAulay estates.[9]\nRenovations to the Ardincaple Estate\nSketch by Robert Adam of his planned addition to Ardincaple Castle in 1774.\nThe estate was then purchased by John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll,[11] and remained in possession of the Campbells well into the 19th century. It was during the Campbell's tenure as lairds of Ardencaple in the 18th century that extensive development was done on the estate by Robert Adam - Scotland's foremost architect of the time. In 1764, while the house was in possession of Lord Frederick Campbell, Robert Adam was first consulted about work on the castle. The house was then irregularly shaped, and Adam came up with a plan for the addition of castle-style additions on the western side of the house which faced the Gare Loch. However, nothing came of this scheme and it wasn't until 1774 that Adam came up with a set of drawings for an addition to the southern half of the west front of the house. This addition was made up of three-bay-windowed, D-shaped tower set in between two smaller turrets (pictured left). Later photographs of Ardincaple Castle show that Adam's extension had been altered or that some features present in his sketch were omitted from being implemented. For instance, the conical roofs, the crow-stepped gable in the sketch do not appear in photographs of the castle. Photographs of Ardincaple Castle show that the tower and southern turret had one more storey than appear in Adam's sketch According to David King, it is possible that Adam was responsible for the added extra floor to the tower, but that is it very unlikely Adam altered the turret because the altered turret broke the symmetry of the addition. Also, Adam had planned that the tower would contain a D-shaped dressing room on its main floor (upper floor). However, it was later decided to make the room oval shaped. David King remarks that Adam had planned a pleasant ceiling for this room, but that there is no sign of it in photographs of 1957.[12] George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll was born at Ardencaple Castle on 30 April 1823.[13] By 1852 the Duchess Dowager of Argyll sold the Ardencaple estate to the wealthy Colquhouns of Luss.[14] Ardencaple Castle Light. Today the tower is used as a navigational aid for shipping on the Firth of Clyde. Photo by Robie Macauley.\nModern era and destruction of the castle\nIn 1923, Sir Iain Colquhoun sold the castle to Mrs. H. Macaulay-Stromberg,[15] a wealthy American, who restored the castle and lived there until her death, in 1931.[16] The castle then passed to Adelaide Parker Voorheis until 1935,[16] when it passed to a consortium of developers who had constructed, in 1936-1937 a housing estate on what used to be the Tower Lawn.[16] The castle then was requisitioned by the Royal Navy[16] with the outbreak of World War II.\nIn 1957 most of the castle was demolished by the government in order to build naval housing for the nearby HMNB Clyde (Faslane Naval Base & Royal Naval Armaments Depot, Coulport), though one tower was left to be used as a mount for navigational beacons and transit lights for the Royal Navy.[17] From then on, the 45-foot (14 m) high tower was known as \"Ardencaple Castle Range Rear Light\", and had two green lights mounted on its south-west corner.[1] Ardencaple Castle has been considered a Category B listed building since 14 May 1971.[3] Today, all that remains of the grand turreted mansion is one solitary tower.\nGallery\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Ardencaple Castle.

    "text": "Aros Castle, also known as Dounarwyse Castle, is a ruined 13th-century castle near Salen on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. The castle overlooks the Sound of Mull.\nHistory\nThe castle was probably built by one of the MacDougall lords of Lorn in the 13th century. Documentary evidence from the late 14th century records it as Dounarwyse Castle in the possession of the Lords of the Isles. The castle was initially a stronghold of the Clan MacDougall. When they backed the losing side in the dispute between Edward I and Robert de Bruys, their lands were declared forfeit and the castle was given by King Robert to Angus Og of Islay Lord of the Isles and Clan Donald. During the late 14th and 15th centuries, it was used as an occasional base by the Lords of the Isles, at which time it was known as Dounarwyse Castle. When, some centuries later, the latter tried to conquer Scotland, they too had their lands declared forfeit, and this time Clan Maclean gained the Castle at MacDonald expense.\nLord Ochiltree entertained the Island Chiefs here in 1608 before making them prisoners. It was described as 'ruinous, old, useless and never of any strength' in 1688 but seems to have been garrisoned by Argyll's troops in 1690. No evidence exists of any occupation in the 18th century or later.\nStatus\nIt is a scheduled monument that includes the 13th-century hall-house and bailey with traces of other buildings, possibly of a later date, and a small stone-built galley landing east of the bailey.[1] References\nRoyal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland listing - Aros Castle, CANMORE\nMike Salter, Castles of Western and Northern Scotland 1995\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

The castle dates back to the 13th century and is the seat of Clan MacLean.[1] One source states that the castle was \"brought back from ruin in 1911\".[2] The regimental colours of the WW1 Canadian Expeditionary Force 236th Battalion (New Brunswick Kilties), CEF are laid up in the Great Hall.\nHistory\nDuart Castle was probably built by Clan MacDougall in the 13th century, and appears to have come into the hands of Clan MacLean in the following century.[3]\nIn 1350, Lachlan Lubanach Maclean of Duart, the 5th Clan Chief, married Mary Macdonald, daughter of John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, and Duart was part of her dowry.[4] John of Islay's son, Donald Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, confirmed the castle by charter to the Macleans in 1390.\nIn 1647, Duart Castle was attacked and laid siege to by the Argyll government troops of Clan Campbell, but they were defeated and driven off by the Royalist troops of Clan MacLean.\nIn September 1653, a Cromwellian task force of six ships anchored off the castle, but the Macleans had already fled to Tiree. A storm blew up on the 13 September and three ships were lost, including Swan. To the north of the castle is a Historic Marine Protected Area within which lie the remains of a wrecked 17th century warship, believed to be the Swan.[5]\nIn 1678, the 9th Earl of Argyll, Chief of Clan Campbell and son of the late Marquess of Argyll, successfully invaded the Clan MacLean lands on the Isle of Mull and Sir John Maclean, 4th Baronet, fled the castle and withdrew to Cairnbulg Castle, and afterward to Kintail under the protection of the 3rd Earl of Seaforth.[6]\nIn 1691, Duart Castle was surrendered by Sir John Maclean, 4th Baronet, to the 10th Earl of Argyll (who was later created, in 1701, the 1st Duke of Argyll).[1] The Campbell clan partially demolished the castle, and the stones from the walls were scattered. The 5th Laird of Torloisk used some of the stones to build a cottage for his family close to the site of the castle.[7]\nBy 1751 the remains of the castle were abandoned.[8]\nDescendants of the 1st Duke of Argyll sold the castle in 1801, to MacQuarrie, who then sold it to Carter-Campbell of Possil who kept it as a ruin within the grounds of his own estate to the north, Torosay Castle. He later sold his Torosay Estate, which now included the ruins of Castle Duart, to A. C. Guthrie in 1865. On 11 September 1911, the ruin was separated from the rest of the Torosay Estate and was bought by Sir Fitzroy Donald Maclean, the 26th Chief of the Clan MacLean, and restored.[1][9][10]\nBy 2012, additional restorations were required and a fund was set up to accept donations for this purpose. Phase 7 of the project was underway in 2020.[11]\nLairds of Duart\nLairds are owners of an estate.\nLachlan Lubanach Maclean, 5th Chief, 1st laird of Duart, it was part of his wife's dowry.[4]\nRed Hector of the Battles Maclean, 6th Chief, 2nd laird of Duart.\nLachlan Bronneach Maclean, 7th Chief, 3rd laird of Duart.\nLachlan Og Maclean, 8th Chief, 4th laird of Duart.\nHector Odhar Maclean, 9th Chief, 5th laird of Duart.\nLachlan Maclean, 10th Chief, 6th laird of Duart.\nLachlan Cattanach Maclean, 11th Chief, 7th laird of Duart.\nHector Mor Maclean, 12th Chief (1497–1568), 8th laird of Duart.\nHector Og Maclean, 13th Chief, 9th laird of Duart.\nLachlan Mor Maclean, 14th Chief, 10th laird of Duart.\nSir Hector Og Maclean, 15th Chief, 11th laird of Duart.\n...\nSir John Maclean, 4th Baronet, 16th Laird of Duart.

In the winter of 2013–14 the castle lost four ceilings, which were brought down by water penetration through the chimneys. In July 2014, a restoration appeal was launched.[12]\nFilm location\nThe castle was used as a location in the 1945 film I Know Where I'm Going! (as \"Castle of Sorne\"). It was also featured in the 1971 film When Eight Bells Toll, starring Anthony Hopkins and in the 1999 film Entrapment, starring Sean Connery (who has MacLean ancestry on his mother's side) and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\nIt is also the setting for the base of Buffy Summers in the first half of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight.[citation needed]\nLighthouse\nTo the south east of the castle is the Duart Point lighthouse.

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunaverty_Castle",
    "text": "\"Dunaverty\" redirects here. For heritage-listed house in Brisbane, Australia, see Dunaverty, Albion.\nHistoric site\nDunaverty Castle is located at Southend at the southern end of the Kintyre peninsula in western Scotland. The site was once a fort belonging to the Clan Donald (MacDonald). Little remains of the castle,[1] although the site is protected as a scheduled monument.[2]\nHistory\nThe remains of Dunaverty Castle stand on a rocky head land on the south east corner of Kintyre, Scotland. The headland it was built on forms a natural stronghold with the sea on three sides and is only approachable from the north. It is attached to the mainland only by a narrow path. It is known that the castle itself was accessed by a drawbridge.\n13th century\nIn 1248, Henry III, King of England allowed Walter Byset to buy stores from Ireland for Dunaverty Castle which he had seized and was fortifying, apparently in revenge for hospitality given by Alexander II, King of Scotland to certain English pirates. However during that same year the castle was taken by Allan, the son of the Earl of Atholl, and Byset was taken prisoner.\nIn 1263, Dunaverty Castle was garrisoned by Alexander III, King of Scotland during the Norwegian campaign of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway.\nThe castle was eventually surrendered to the Norwegian king, who in turn granted it to Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí, one of his steadfast supporters in the Hebrides. With the evaporation of Norwegian sovereignty in the Hebrides after 1263, Alexander III appears to have retaken the castle.[3]\n14th century\nLate in 1306, the embattled Robert I, King of Scotland seems to have fled to the safety of Dunaverty Castle and his friend, Aonghus Óg Mac Domhnaill, the Lord of the Isles. According to The Bruce, the king was harboured there for three days by Aonghus Óg Mac Domhnaill, before Aonghus took him to Rathlin Island. Some contemporary sources suggest that the castle was already under the king's control, however, and that the king acquired it from a certain Maol Coluim in March. In September of that year, when the English arrived at the castle, the Scottish king was not to be found.\n15th century\nIn 1493 the fourth and last Lord of the Isles forfeited his title to James IV, King of Scotland. By 1494 the king had garrisoned and provisioned Dunaverty Castle. It is said that the MacDonalds, led by Sir John MacDonald whom the king had recently knighted, retook the castle before the King had even departed to Stirling and that the dead body of the King's castle governor was hung over the castle walls in sight of the King and his departing entourage. Sir John Macdonald however was later captured by MacIain of Ardnamurchan. He was tried and hanged on the Burgh Muir near Edinburgh.\n16th century\nThe castle was repaired by the crown between 1539 and 1542. In January 1544, a Commission in Queen Mary's name was given to the captain, constable and keeper of the Castle of Dunaverty, to deliver it with its artillery and ammunition to the Earl of Argyll and in April of that year Argyll received a 12-year tack of North and South Kintyre, including the castle.\nThe English raided Kintyre and Campbeltown Loch in October 1588 because of the activities of the Clan MacDonald in Ireland. The Earl of Sussex sailed from Dublin in the Mary Willoughby with a small fleet and burnt Saddell, Dunaverty and Machrimore. He then burnt farms on Arran, Bute, and Cumbrae.[4]\n17th century\nIn 1626, the Lordship of Kintyre was reconstituted in favour of the Earl of Argyll and Dunaverty Castle was denoted as its principal messuage. Argyll bestowed the Lordship of Kintyre on James, his eldest son by his second marriage, who, in 1635, at Dunaverty, granted a charter of the Lordship to Viscount Dunluce, eldest son of Randal MacDonnell, 1st Earl of Antrim. The transfer was set aside by the Scottish Privy Council, no doubt on a complaint by Argyll's eldest son, the Marquis of Lorn, who had bitterly resented his father's bestowal of the Lordship on his younger half-brother. On 12 December 1636, Lorn received a charter, under the Great Seal, of the Lordship of Kintyre, with the Castle of Dunaverty as its principal messuage.\nDuring the Civil War Dunaverty was besieged in 1647 by Scottish supporters of Oliver Cromwell who were led by General David Leslie (Leslie later became a Royalist). The MacDonalds surrendered and then 300 of them were massacred. This incident became known as the Battle of Dunaverty, or \"Dunaverty Massacre\". The castle is nothing more than a ruin now, known as Blood Rock for the massacre which took place there.\nSee also\nScottish castles\nCitations\nReferences\nBarrow, GWS (1981).

The Irish annals record that \"Dun Ollaigh\" was attacked or burned down three times, in 686, 698, and in 701.[1] It was subsequently rebuilt in 714 by Selbach mac Ferchair (died 730), the King of Dál Riata credited with destroying the site in 701.[1][2] Excavations in the 1970s suggest that this early fortification was abandoned some time in the 10th century.[3]\nThe area around Dunollie subsequently became part of the semi-independent Kingdom of the Isles, ruled over by Somerled in the 12th century. On his death the MacDougalls became Lords of Lorne.[2] Dougall, Somerled's son, held most of Argyll and also the islands of Mull, Lismore, Jura, Tiree, Coll and many others in the 12th century.\nExcavations show that Dunollie was refortified with an earthwork castle in the 13th century or potentially the late 12th century. The builder may have been Dougall, or his son Duncan.[4] Ewan MacDougall, great-grandson of Somerled and the third chief of the MacDougalls, switched the clan's allegiance in the mid 13th century: initially allied with Haakon IV of Norway, from the 1250s Ewan remained loyal to the kings of Scotland.\nIn the 14th century Ewan's grandson John MacDougall, along with his kinsmen the Comyns, sided with the Balliols against the interests of Robert the Bruce. John MacDougall's army defeated the Bruce at the Battle of Dalrigh in 1306, but Bruce returned in 1308 and crushed the MacDougalls at the Battle of the Pass of Brander. The MacDougall lands of Lorne were subsequently forfeit and were given to the Campbells, though Dunollie and other estates were regained later in the 14th century.\nDunollie Castle - painting by Sir George Reid\nThe existing castle ruins date largely from the 15th century.[5]\nThe Marquis of Argyll captured the castle in 1644, but it was returned to the MacDougalls in 1661. In 1746, the MacDougalls abandoned Dunollie Castle and built Dunollie House just downhill from the castle ruins.\nIn recent years, a charitable trust was formed titled The MacDougall of Dunollie Preservation Trust, who are responsible for the care of the historic buildings and collections held in this an ancestral site. Today, the Dunollie Preservation Trust operates Dunollie Museum, Castle & Grounds - a visitor attractions and social enterprise. Through the running of this organisation, all funds raised contribute to ongoing conservation and development efforts as well as education and learning.[6] Remains of a historical herb garden have recently been discovered in the castle grounds.\nGallery Dunollie Castle Oban, Dunollie Castle Dunollie Castle - May 2016\nSee also\nRoyalist rising of 1651 to 1654\nDunstaffnage Castle\nReferences\nSources\nAlcock, Leslie; Alcock, Elizabeth A (1987). \"Reconnaissance excavations on early historic fortifications and other royal sites in Scotland, 1974-84: 2, Excavations at Dunollie Castle, Oban, Argyll, 1978\" (PDF).

    "text": "Castle in Argyll and Bute, Scotland\nDunoon Castle is a ruined castle in Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, Scotland. The castle sat upon a cone-shaped hill about 80 feet (24 m) high. Very little remains of the castle's structure today. Castle House, built in 1822, stands a few yards north of the castle ruins.[1]\nThe remains of the castle, and a surrounding area, are a scheduled monument.[2][3]\nThe castle was a royal residence in the 14th century, and in the 17th century fell into ruins.[4]\n13th–15th century\nDunoon Castle engraving by William Miller after W Brown\nDunoon Castle Entrance\nThe castle is first recorded in the thirteenth century.[5] It may have been constructed in the context of the Stewarts increasing authority in Cowal.[6]\nIn 1333 Dunoon Castle was besieged and taken by Edward Balliol, who surrendered it to Edward III of England.[7] An insurrection ensued, driving Baliol out of Scotland. Robert the Steward, later King Robert II of Scotland, arrived in Cowal and, with the help of Colin Campbell of Lochow, retook the castle.[8]\nJames III undertook to repay his Master of Household, Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll for repairs to the castle in 1468, and made him keeper of the castle in 1472.[9] By the 15th century it was a royal castle with the Campbells as hereditary keepers.[5]\n16th century\nIn 1544 Dunoon Castle was besieged by Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox. Having eighteen ships and 800 soldiers provided by Henry VIII of England, Lennox succeeded in taking the Castles of Dunoon and Rothesay. Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll, was driven out, sustaining great loss.[10]\nIn 1563, Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed at the castle while visiting her half-sister, Jean Stewart, Countess of Argyll, and granted several charters during her visit.[11] Mary's rebels met up at Dunoon during the Chaseabout Raid. Her brother the Earl of Moray's faction in Argyll included the Duke of Châtelherault, and the Earls of Argyll and Rothes. They left for Ayrshire on 18 August 1565.[12]\n17th century\nIn 1646 occurred the Dunoon massacre in which the Campbells slaughtered men, women, children, and infants of Clan Lamont.[13] After the restoration of the episcopacy under Charles II, Dunoon became the residence of the bishops of Argyll for a time.[14]\nThe castle was destroyed during the Earl of Argyll's rebellion against James VII and II in 1685.\n20th century\nDuring World War I and II, military fortifications were established at Dunoon Castle for the defense of the River Clyde and the shipbuilding industry.[15]\nReferences\nExternal links\nMap sources for Dunoon Castle\nVisit Scotland webpage for Dunoon Castle\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, UK\nDunstaffnage Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Caisteal Dhùn Stadhainis) is a partially ruined castle in Argyll and Bute, western Scotland. It lies 3 miles (5 km) NNE of Oban, situated on a platform of conglomerate rock on a promontory at the south-west of the entrance to Loch Etive, and is surrounded on three sides by the sea.[1] The castle and the nearby chapel ruin have been a Historic Scotland property since 1958.[2] Both are Scheduled Ancient Monuments.[3][4]\nThe castle dates back to the 13th century, making it one of Scotland's oldest stone castles, in a local group which includes Castle Sween and Castle Tioram.[5] Guarding a strategic location, it was built by the MacDougall lords of Lorn, and has been held since the 15th century by the Clan Campbell. To this day there is a hereditary Captain of Dunstaffnage, although they no longer reside at the castle. Dunstaffnage is maintained by Historic Environment Scotland, and is open to the public, although the 16th century gatehouse is retained as the private property of the Captain. The prefix dun in the name means \"fort\" in Gaelic, while the rest of the name derives from Norse stafr-nis, \"headland of the staff\".\nHistory\nBefore Dunstaffnage\nBefore the construction of the castle, Dunstaffnage may have been the location of a Dál Riatan stronghold, known as Dun Monaidh, as early as the 7th century.[6] It was recorded, by John Monipennie in 1612, that the Stone of Destiny was kept here after being brought from Ireland, and before it was moved to Scone Palace in 843. However, Iona and Dunadd are considered more likely, given their known connections with Dál Riatan and Strathclyde kings.[7] Hector Boece records that the stone was kept at \"Evonium\", which has traditionally been identified with Dunstaffnage, although in 2010 the writer A. J. Morton identified Evonium with Irvine in Ayrshire.[8]\nThe MacDougalls\nThere was a castle here in the time of Somerled, Lord of the Isles.[9] However, the castle became the seat of Duncan MacDougall, Lord of Lorn and grandson of Somerled in the second quarter of the 13th century.[10] He had also travelled to Rome in 1237 and was the founder of nearby Ardchattan Priory.[11] Duncan's son Ewen MacDougall inherited his father's title in the 1240s, and expanded the MacDougall influence, styling himself \"King of the Isles\" though that title belonged to the MacDonalds. It is probable that Ewen built the three round towers onto the castle, and constructed and enlarged the hall inside.[12]\nFollowing Alexander III's repulse of the Norse influence in Argyll, the MacDougalls backed the Scottish monarchy, and Ewen's son Alexander was made the first sheriff of Argyll in 1293. However, they supported the Balliol side during the Wars of Scottish Independence which broke out a few years later. Robert Bruce defeated the Clan MacDougall at the Battle of the Pass of Brander in August 1308. After a brief siege, King Robert took control of the MacDougall castle of Dunstaffnage.[13] He did not destroy it, as he did others, but appointed a constable and provisioned it, thinking to use it to guard the countryside and seaways. With the land he gave his friend, Angus Og Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, that included much of the MacDougall lands, including nearby Mull, the castle could be well used for that purpose by the Isleman.\nRoyal fortress\nNow a Crown property, Dunstaffnage was controlled by a series of keepers. James I seized the castle in 1431, following the Battle of Inverlochy, as his enemies were hiding inside. In 1455 James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas stayed at Dunstaffnage, on his way to treat with John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles.[14] This followed James II's attack on Douglas power, and led to the signing of the Treaty of Westminster-Ardtornish. A later keeper, John Stewart of Lorn, was a rival of Alan MacDougall, and was stabbed by his supporters on his way to his marriage at Dunstaffnage Chapel in 1463, although he survived long enough to make his vows. Although MacDougall took the castle, he was ousted by James III, who granted Dunstaffnage to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll in 1470.[15]\nThe south facade of Dunstaffnage Castle\nClan Campbell\nThe Earls of Argyll appointed Captains to oversee Dunstaffnage, and keep it in readiness, on their behalf. Changes were made to the buildings, particularly the gatehouse, which was rebuilt around this time. The Campbells were loyal allies of the royal house, and Dunstaffnage was used as a base for government expeditions against the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, among others, during the 15th and 16th centuries. James IV visited Dunstaffnage on two occasions.[14]\nDunstaffnage saw action during the Civil War, holding out against Montrose's army in 1644. The castle was burned by royalist troops, following the failure of Argyll's Rising in 1685, against the Catholic James VII.[16] During the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745, the castle was occupied by government troops. Flora MacDonald, who helped Bonnie Prince Charlie to escape from Scotland, was briefly imprisoned here while en route to imprisonment in London.[14]\nAccording to W. Douglas Simpson the castle appears in Tobias Smollet's Humphry Clinker, which although not naming Dunstaffnage, presents \"a fair picture of life in the castle in the third quarter of the eighteenth century\".[17]\nDecline and restoration\nThe Campbells continued to add to the castle, building a new house over the old west range in 1725. However, the rest of the castle was already decaying. In 1810 an accidental fire gutted the gatehouse, and the Captains ceased to live here, moving to Dunstaffnage House some 2 km to the south-east.[14] Tenants lived in the 1725 house within the castle until 1888.[18]\nRestoration work was undertaken in 1903 by the Duke of Argyll, the castle's owner. This was followed in 1912 by a court case, in which the Court of Session ruled that Angus Campbell, the 20th hereditary Captain, had right of residence notwithstanding the Duke of Argyll's ownership. Works were delayed by World War I, and the planned total restoration was never completed.[19] In 1958, the 21st Captain and the Duke agreed to hand the castle into state care,[18] and it is now open to the public as a Historic Environment Scotland property.[3][4]\nDescription\nPlans of Dunstaffnage Castle\nWalls\nDunstaffnage is an irregular quadrangular structure of great strength, with rounded towers at three of the angles. It measures approximately 35 by 30 metres (115 by 98 ft), and has a circumference of about 120 metres (390 ft). The walls are of coursed rubble, with sandstone dressings, and stand up to 18 m (60 ft) high, including the conglomerate bedrock platform. The walls are up to 3 m (10 ft) thick, affording strong defence to this highly strategic location, guarding the entrance to Loch Etive and the Pass of Brander beyond, and today commanding a splendid view. The parapet walk, which once followed the whole of the walls, has been partially restored with new stone flags. The original parapet is now also gone. Arrow slits, later converted into gunloops, are the only openings. Brass cannon recovered from wrecked vessels of the Spanish Armada were once mounted on the walls.[1]\nRound towers\nSoon after the construction of the castle walls, three round towers were built on the north, east, and west towers. The north tower, or donjon, is the largest, comprising three or four storeys originally, and probably housed the lord's private apartments.[20] The west tower is almost internal, barely projecting beyond the rounded corner of the curtain wall, and could only be entered via the parapet walk. The basement level contains a pit prison which was accessed from above. The east tower was almost completely rebuilt in the late 15th century as a gatehouse. Each tower was probably once topped by a conical roof.[21]\nThe gatehouse, with the remains of the north-east hall range to the left\nThe gatehouse\nThe gatehouse was built by the Campbells in the late 15th century, replacing an earlier round tower in the east corner. It takes the form of a four-storey harled tower house, with the entrance passage running through half the vaulted basement, the other half forming guard rooms with arrow slits facing the gate. The present approach to the gate is by a stone stair, replacing an earlier drawbridge.[22] The tower was remodelled in the 18th century to provide reception rooms and a private suite. The dormer windows at the top are capped by the pediments from the 1725 house (see below), and bear the date, the Campbell arms, and the initials AEC and DLC, for Aeneas Campbell, 11th Captain, and his wife Dame Lilias. The pediments were moved here during the 1903 restoration works.[23]\nInternal ranges\nThe north-west range of 1725, with the gatehouse on the right, seen from the parapet walk\nThe east range was located between the north and east towers, although only foundations remain. This was the principal range of buildings and contained a large hall above vaulted cellars.[24] The hall had double-lancet windows, decorated with carved patterns, which were later blocked up; their outlines can be seen in the east curtain wall.\nA second range stood along the north-west wall, and would have been connected to the hall range by the donjon tower. The ground floor housed a kitchen. In 1725 the range was remodelled into a two-storey house, accessed via a stone stair, and topped with the dormer windows which now form part of the gatehouse. The well in front is original, although the large stone surround is of 19th century date.[25]\nEast end of Dunstaffnage Chapel, showing the lancet windows and the Campbell burial aisle beyond\nDunstaffnage Chapel\nA ruined chapel lies around 150 metres (490 ft) to the south-west of the castle. This was also built by Duncan MacDougall of Lorn, as a private chapel, and features detailed stonework of outstanding quality. Experts believe that the chapel was built in the second quarter of the 13th century. The chapel is 20 by 6 metres (66 by 20 ft), and formerly had a timber roof. The lancet windows carry dog-tooth carving, and have fine wide-splayed arches internally. The chapel was already ruinous in 1740, when a burial aisle was built on to the east end, to serve as a resting place for the Campbells of Dunstaffnage.[26][27]\nCaptain of Dunstaffnage\nTraditionally, an officer called the Hereditary Captain of Dunstaffnage is responsible for the castle and its defence. The office still exists, and to retain the title (now rather a sinecure without military significance), the incumbent is required to spend three nights a year in the castle. No other responsibilities or privileges now attach to the post.\nCastle ghost\nA ghost, known as the \"Ell-maid of Dunstaffnage\", is said to haunt the castle. A type of gruagach, the ghost's appearances are said to be associated with events in the lives of the hereditary keepers.[14]\nNotes\nDunstaffnage Castle, 1836 engraving by William Miller after J. M.

    "text": "Castle in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, UK\nRuins of Dunyvaig Castle\nDunyvaig Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Naomhaig, Anglicised Fort of the galleys, also known as Dunnyveg)[1] is located on the south side of Islay, in Argyll, Scotland, on the shore of Lagavulin Bay, 4 kilometres (2+1⁄2 miles) from Port Ellen.[1] The castle was once a naval base of the Lord of the Isles, chiefs of Clan Donald. It was held by the chiefs of the Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg.\nHistory\n12th century\nA castle was built by Somerled, King of the Isles, on top of a fort or dun on a rocky promontory jutting into Lagavulin Bay.\n13th and 14th centuries\nThe castle was held by the Macdonalds, Lords of the Isles, Somerled's descendants, specifically, Angus Mor Macdonald and his sons, Alexander Og and Angus Og. They used Lagavulin Bay as an anchorage for their fleet of galleys.\n15th and 16th centuries\nForfeited in 1493, the castle passed to the MacIans of Ardnamurchan.[2] The MacIans were descended from John Macdonald, younger brother of Angus Og Macdonald, Lord of the Isles and friend of Robert the Bruce, and suffered when that clan was punished for the 1501-1506 insurrection of Black Donald; the castle was transferred to a branch of the Campbells. In 1545, however, the MacDonald holdings in Islay and Jura were restored to them.[2]\nMary, Queen of Scots planned a visit to Argyll in June 1563. Agnes Campbell, the wife of James MacDonald of Dunyvaig, gave the queen a \"marvellous fair\" costume of \"Hyeland apparell\".[3] In 1598 the castle was kept by John Stewart of Arskok who was given £3000 Scots yearly for the expenses.[4]\n17th century\nAngus MacDonald, 8th of Dunnyveg surrendered the castle by negotiation to the king's lieutenant Andrew Stuart, 3rd Lord Ochiltree and the Bishop of the Isles Andrew Knox who brought a royal naval force with 1000 men on 2 August 1608. On 5 August Angus MacDonald and others came aboard the Advantage to celebrate Gowrie day, the anniversary of the rescue of James VI of Scotland at Perth in 1600. A garrison loyal to the king was installed.[5]\nIn 1614, the castle was taken by Ranald Og Macdonald, however it was retaken by Angus Og MacDonald, who attempted to bargain the castle's surrender. Knox attempted to retake the castle in September 1614 and was defeated and compelled to retreat. Knox left his son Thomas and his nephew John Knox of Ranfurly as hostages for his good faith.\nKnox wrote to the lawyer Thomas Hamilton explaining these events and his actions after accusations that his inaction and sloth had led to the capture of the castle by the MacDonalds. He said his negotiation for the castle's surrender had stalled, and he had found it difficult to hire boats to take him from Arran to Dunyvaig during the harvest time. The MacLeans and McLeods of Harris refused to serve with him, and he could raise no more than seventy men, of whom fifty were waged soldiers and twenty followers of the lairds of Ardincaple and Ranfurly. When he landed on Islay, lacking any further armed support, the Clan Donald of Islay, outmanoeuvred him and cut him off from his boats, which they looted and destroyed. The next day Knox was told he should surrender the two hostages or all his men would be executed. Knox noted that the MacDonalds had built a new fort in the loch. Some of his men had heard Angus Og MacDonald say he was working for the Earl of Argyll, who would give him the castle and the whole lands of Islay.[6] Thomas Hamilton wrote to Knox, who was at Brodick Castle offering the services of the Earl of Caithness and his cannon, but noting it was too late in the year.[7]\nGeorge Graham negotiated the freedom of the two hostages or \"gentlemen prisoners\" although he lacked official support except a verbal promise from the Chancellor, Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline of a cash reward.[8] On 6 January 1615, Sir John Campbell of Calder, with the assistance of Sir Oliver Lambart who brought artillery and men in the Phoenix and retook the castle.[9] Lambert captured 22 men while 22 others including Coll Ciotach escaped from a postern gate into a longboat.[10]\nIn June 1615 Sir James MacDonald and Coll Ciotach captured the castle again, killing the captain and some of the garrison. The Privy Council of Scotland asked for a pinnace with cannon to batter the castle. Sir James MacDonald fled, and on 13 October 1615 before the guns were landed from the Charles and a barque Coll Ciotach surrendered to Argyll.[11]\nThe castle was seized in 1647 by the Covenanters and passed into the hands of the Campbells of Cawdor, who held it until 1677, when Sir Hugh Campbell pulled down the castle and moved to Islay House.[2]\nRuins\nToday all that remains of the castle are mainly the ruins of the sixteenth-century castle, although the site includes a thirteenth-century courtyard, and a fifteenth-century keep.[2] The site was designated as a scheduled monument in 1989.[12]\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Dunyvaig Castle.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070622063122/http://www.highlandconnection.org/castles/dunnyvegcastle.html\n55°38′01″N 6°07′23″W / 55.63361°N 6.12306°W / 55.63361; -6.12306\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

The fortress was once a stronghold of Clan Campbell.\nThe castle and the island are jointly a designated scheduled monument.[1]\nHistory\nThe castle that stands on the wooded island of Innis Chonnell has thick outer walls.[2] It was the original stronghold of the Clan Campbell from possibly the eleventh century or earlier.[2] It was the seat of Cailean Mór (Sir Colin Campbell) who was killed fighting the Clan MacDougall at the Battle of Red Ford in 1296.[2] Later John MacDougall held the castle against Robert the Bruce in 1308.[2] Sir Colin Campbell's son, Sir Neil Campbell, married Bruce's sister, Mary, and Sir Neil fought for the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.[2] Innis Chonnel Castle was abandoned by the Campbells as their residence in the fifteenth century, but it was still used as a prison.[2] The young Domhnall Dubh (\"Black Donald\"), son of Aonghas Óg (Angus) and heir to the Lordship of the Isles, was imprisoned in the castle after the Battle of Bloody Bay, which took place off the coast of the Isle of Mull in 1484.[2] He escaped but after invading Badenoch in 1503 he was recaptured and imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle for forty years.[2] Innis Chonnell Castle was in ruins by the nineteenth century.[2]\nReferences\nExternal links\nRoyal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland listing - Innes Chonnel Castle Archived 19 October 2012 at the Wayback Machine, CANMORE\n56°15′24″N 5°16′03″W / 56.2568°N 5.2675°W / 56.2568; -5.2675\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothesay_Castle",
    "text": "Castle in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, UK\nRothesay Castle is a ruined castle in Rothesay, the principal town on the Isle of Bute, in western Scotland. Located at NS086646, the castle has been described as \"one of the most remarkable in Scotland\",[1] for its long history dating back to the beginning of the 13th century, and its unusual circular plan.\nThe castle comprises a huge curtain wall, strengthened by four round towers, together with a 16th-century forework, the whole surrounded by a broad moat. Built by the Stewart family, it survived Norse attacks to become a royal residence. Though falling into ruin after the 17th century, the castle was repaired by the Marquess of Bute before passing into state care in the 20th century.\nA paddle steamer named after the castle was constructed in 1816.\nThe early castle\nThe castle was built either by Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland (died 1204), or by his succeeding son Walter (died 1246). During Alan's tenure, the family added the Isle of Bute to their lordship.[2] A wooden castle was constructed first, but the stone circular curtain wall was in place by the 1230s, when the castle was attacked and taken by the Norwegian-backed fleet of Óspakr-Hákon, King of the Isles (died 1230). According to Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar, Óspakr's forces fought for three days to take the castle, breaking down part of the eastern wall by hewing the stone with their axes. This saga is the earliest recorded account of an assault on a Scottish castle.[3] In 1263, Rothesay was taken again by the Norwegian forces under Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1263) before the Battle of Largs. Although the Battle of Largs is called indecisive, Hákon's campaign was a failure, the Norse retreated, and it effectively ended Norwegian authority in western Scotland.\nThe early castle comprised only the roughly circular curtain wall, 2.7 m (9 ft) thick, 7.9 m (26 ft) high and around 42 m (138 ft) in diameter, built on a low mound, with a battlement on top accessed by open stairs.[4][5] The moat was connected to the sea, the shoreline then being closer to the north-east of the Castle than it is today. The broad crenellations can be made out within the walls, which were later raised. Holes in the upper wall would have supported a timber bretasche, a projecting structure serving as an extended battlement. This curtain wall was built of coursed ashlar, and had only two openings in its length. The main gate was an arched opening with a simple timber door. The second opening was a small postern gate in the west wall, later blocked.\nIn the later part of the 13th century, the castle was strengthened by the addition of four round towers, of which only the north-west survives intact. These three-storey towers had strong splayed bases, with arrow slits below the crenellated parapet. A portcullis was added to the main gate.\nWars of independence and the rise of the Stewarts\nDuring the Wars of Scottish Independence, Rothesay was held by the English, but was taken by Robert the Bruce in 1311. It then returned to English hands in 1334, before being taken again by the Scots. Following the accession of the Stewarts to the throne of Scotland in 1371, the castle became a favourite residence of kings Robert II and Robert III, who died here in 1406. Robert II granted the hereditary keepership of the castle to his son John, ancestor of the Earls and Marquesses of Bute. Robert III made his eldest son David Duke of Rothesay in 1401, beginning a tradition of honouring the heir to the throne of Scotland with this title. In 1462 the castle survived a siege by the forces of John of Islay, Earl of Ross and the last Lord of the Isles.\n16th and 17th centuries\nIn the early 16th century Rothesay Castle was strengthened again. Construction of a gatehouse keep, extending from the north of the curtain wall, began around the turn of the century, to provide more modern accommodation for James IV. The curtain wall itself was raised up to ten metres in height, the works continuing into the reign of James V. In 1527 the castle withstood another siege by the Master of Ruthven, which destroyed much of the burgh of Rothesay. In 1544, the castle fell to the Earl of Lennox, acting for the English during the so-called \"Rough Wooing\".\nThe forework is an L-plan structure, which jutted into the moat and was accessed by a drawbridge. The lower floor comprised a vaulted entrance tunnel running into the older castle courtyard. Above, the four-storey tower contained royal lodgings, and still bears the royal coat of arms above the door. Also in the early 16th century, a chapel was constructed inside the old castle. Simple in form, the chapel measured around 7 m (23 ft) by 14 m (45 ft), and is now the only surviving structure within the curtain wall.[4] The north-west tower was converted into a doocot, and is known as the \"Pigeon Tower\", due to the nest boxes built into the outside wall.\nEsmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, a favourite of James VI was compelled by the Ruthven Regime to leave Scotland. He went first to Dumbarton Castle, then stayed at Rothesay Castle in October 1582.[6]\nRothesay was garrisoned for the occupying forces of Oliver Cromwell, who invaded Scotland with his New Model Army in the early 1650s. On their departure in 1660, the troops partially dismantled the structure. What was left was burned by the supporters of Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll during his rising of 1685, in support of the Monmouth Rebellion against James VII.\nRepair and restoration\nThe vaulted entrance tunnel.\nFollowing a long period of neglect, the 2nd Marquess of Bute employed 70 men to excavate the ruins, clearing large amounts of rubbish from the castle in 1816–17. But it was not until the 1871 that work resumed and the ruins were stabilised.[7] The 3rd Marquess, a keen restorer of historic buildings, embarked upon a series of repairs and restorations, following surveys and advice from his regular architect William Burges. His \"restorations\" continued until 1900, and include the clearing and shaping of the moat, as well as the red sandstone additions to the forework, which reinstated the hall roof while significantly altering the character of the building.\nIn 1961 Rothesay Castle was given to the state, and is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.[8]\nThe castle is open to visitors year round. Fine views can be seen from the top of the walls over the town and back towards the mainland.\nNotes\n^ Lindsay (1986), p.412\n^ Barrow, Geoffrey Wallis Steuart (2004). \"Stewart family\".

    "text": "11th century castle in Scotland\nCastle Sween, also known as Caisteal Suibhne,[1] and Caistéal Suibhne,[2] is located on the eastern shore of Loch Sween, in Knapdale,[3] south of the forestry village of Achnamara on the west coast of Argyll, Scotland. Castle Sween is thought to be one of the earliest stone castles built in Scotland, having been built in the late 11th century.[4][3] The castle's towers were later additions to wooden structures which have since vanished.[3]\nHistory\nCastle Sween is the oldest stone castle in Scotland, built in the late 11th century by Suibhne, son of Hugh Anrahan, brother of the king of Ulster and High King of Ireland, from whom it takes its name Suibhne.[5]\nAs late as the thirteenth century, the MacSweens possessed the surrounding lands of Knapdale. However, by the second half of the century, these territories passed into the hands of the Stewart/Menteith family.[5]\nIn 1310, Edward II, King of England, granted John MacSween, and his brothers, the MacSweens' ancestral lands of Knapdale, provided that they oust John Menteith. It is possible that MacSween, and his claim to his family's lost Scottish homeland, may be the subject of the Gaelic poem Dál chabhlaigh ar Chaistéal Suibhne. If so, this poem may well refer to an expedition by MacSween to retake Castle Sween in about 1310.[5]\nIn 1323, after the death of John Menteith, the Lordship of Arran and Knapdale passed to his son and grandson. In 1376, half of Knapdale, which included the castle, passed into the possession of John MacDonald I, Lord of the Isles, by a grant from his father-in-law, Robert II, King of Scotland.[5]\nDuring the MacDonalds' century and a half of holding the castle, the castellans were first MacNeils and later MacMillans.[6]\nThe 16th century manuscript known as The Book of the Dean of Lismore includes the lament of Aithbhreac Inghean Coirceadal (f. 1460), which remains a highly important poem in Scottish Gaelic literature. Aithbhreac, after being widowed, composed a lament addressed to the rosary of her late husband, a Tacksman of Clan MacNeil and former constable of Castle Sween.[7]\nIn 1490, Castle Sween was granted to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, by James IV, King of Scotland.[6]\nIn 1647, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Castle Sween was attacked and burnt by Alasdair MacColla and his Irish Confederate followers.[6]\nIn 1933, the castle was put in the care of the Historic Building and Monuments Directorate (HBMD).[8] Currently Castle Sween is under the protection of Historic Scotland.[8]\nConservation\nA 2018 report from Historic Environment Scotland noted that Castle Sween is at \"very high risk\" of coastal erosion due to climate change.[9]\nIn popular culture\nCastle Sween was featured in the 2021 Starz TV series Men in Kilts: A Roadtrip With Sam and Graham (from Outlander) episode 7 \"Clans and Tartans\".[10]\nCitations\nReferences\nArgyll: An Inventory of the Monuments.

Tarbert Castle was a strategic royal stronghold during the Middle Ages and one of three castles at Tarbert. The castle overlooks the harbour and although pre 14th century in construction, the tower dates back to 1494 and the visit of James IV to the Western Highlands.\nHistory\nIn 712, Tarbert was burned by King Selbach mac Ferchair of Cenél Loairn and of Dál Riata and in 731 by his son, Dúngal mac Selbaig.[1]\nKing Edward II of England handed control of the castle to the Scottish King John II de Balliol in 1292. A fortified structure was built in Tarbert during the 13th century. It was reinforced with the addition of an outer bailey and towers in the 1320s by Robert the Bruce. A tower house was added in the 16th century, which is the most noticeable part of the remains. The castle occupies high land above the village, providing views up Loch Fyne and beyond to the Firth of Clyde. This castle was captured from John MacDonald of Islay, Lord of the Isles by James IV of Scotland as part of his campaign to destroy the power of the Lords of the Isles in 1494. In 1687 the castle was involved in another skirmish when Walter Campbell of Skipness Castle seized it as a stronghold for Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll as part of actions in support of the Monmouth Rebellion in England.\nThere are only a couple of standing walls left.

    "text": "This article is about the Auchen Castle ruins. For the hotel and wedding venue, see Auchen Castle Hotel.\nAuchen Castle is a ruined 13th-century quadrangular castle situated near Moffat, Dumfries and Galloway. It was designated as a scheduled ancient monument in 1937.[1]\nHistory\nThe castle was probably built by the Kirkpatrick family in the early to mid-13th century, possibly to replace the nearby motte-and-bailey castle at Garpol Water and command the valley of the River Annan to the east and the ravine formed by Garpol Burn to the south. The first documentary evidence of the estate is from a charter from December 1306 in which Sir Roger de Kirkpatrick loans money to Sir Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford. After Kirkpatrick's death during the siege of Lochmaben Castle in 1313, the lands appear to have been transferred to Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, although it is unclear what happened to them after his death in 1332. By the 15th century, the castle was owned by the Douglasses of Morton, before later passing to the Johnstones of Corehead, possibly during King James II's campaign against the Douglasses.[1][2]\nIn its earliest form, the castle comprised a four-sided enclosure with the entrance on the north wall. It had a round bastion at the north west angle and a garderobe in the east curtain wall. The walls were protected by a broad ditch, except in the north where a causeway passed over a linked pair of fish ponds. The entrance was later reinforced by a dog-leg forework in the form of a pend. In the late 15th or early- to mid-16th century, the castle was adapted for use as an artillery fortification with the walls lowered and reinforced with masonry and earth.[2]\nAn inventory made of goods belonging to the deceased James Douglas of \"Auchencassill\" in October 1483 includes a folding table, a horse, a chalice and altar ornaments, a sword, a featherbed, bed curtains and canopy, and the hangings or apparelling of the hall, a cushion, a silver salt and spoon, kitchen ware, an eel crook, and other items. This selection was claimed by William Douglas of Drumlanrig as his heir.[3]\nReferences\n^ a b Historic Environment Scotland. \"Auchen Castle (SM683)\".

    "text": "Dervorguilla of Galloway by Wilhelm Sonmans\nRuins of Buittle Castle\nBuittle Castle, also known historically as Botle or Botel Castle, is a Motte and Bailey site in Galloway, south-west Scotland with significant early and medieval history comprising a significant ruined Norman style Motte, and several extant buildings and gardens, including the later residential building in the form of the Tower House, on the historic Bailey. It is located in the valley of the River Urr, 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) west of Dalbeattie. The castle is within the parish of Buittle, in the traditional county of Kirkcudbrightshire and is a scheduled ancient monument.[1][2]\nA motte and bailey castle was built either by Uchtred, Lord of Galloway or his son Roland, Lord of Galloway, in the 12th century. The castle passed by marriage to John de Balliol through the heiress of Alan, Lord of Galloway, Dervorguilla of Galloway, who built the Norman castle. Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, captured the castle in 1286. The castle was in English hands in 1296. King Robert the Bruce captured the castle in 1308,[3] and it was given to Sir James Douglas, Lord of Douglas.\nThe castle came into Edward Balliol's hands in 1332, before being given to Archibald the Grim, 3rd Earl of Douglas, in 1372. The castle remained in the hands of the Douglasses until 1456, when the castle reverted to the Crown. The castle was later in the hands of the Maxwells and briefly the Gordons of Lochinvar. The Motte was slighted in 1595, leaving the remaining buildings of the Bailey, which, it is believed, had already been taken on by this time as the primary residential buildings.[4] This residential shift from the motte to the bailey of the castle began, in the first place, with the building of a Mansion House dated to AD 1347,[5] likely affixed to the keep of the bailey, built by Edward Balliol, and latterly by the Tower House as the primary residential building of the castle. By this time in Scottish history, the tower house was the prevailing form of castle, or fortified building in Scotland.[6]\nThe castle was in the ownership of the Maxwells of Buittle by the 16th century,[7] but by the mid 18th century, probably due to a combination of Jacobite associations and changing fashion, the family had moved to Munches House, a Neo-Classical mansion a few miles to the west. It was at this time that the historic Motte and Bailey were put to agricultural use, and subsumed into the larger Munches Estate. Francis Grosse shows the Castle in a roofless state in 1798, with agricultural activities being undertaken in the buildings of the courtyard.[8] The Munches Estate was divided and sold in the mid 20th century, but the ruins of the Motte were separately disponed from the bailey and remained in the possession of the Maxwells of Munches until 1984 when they were gifted to Balliol College, Oxford by Peter Maxwell QC of Munches [1] himself a Balliol man. [2]\nEarly history\nBetween 1993 and 2000 significant archeological excavations were undertaken on the bailey of Buittle Castle, by A. Penman and E Cochrane. From these it has become apparent that the site has been occupied since at least the Mesolithic age, and also was subsequently occupied and, presumably, fortified by the Romans at this strategic point of crossing over the Water of Urr.\nAmongst the finds were a proliferation of Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age artefacts. The digs uncovered evidence of a permanent settlement during the Mesolithic era, temporary settlement during the Neolithic/Early Bronze Age, and permanent Iron Age/Romano-British occupation from the time of Agricola's invasion of Galloway in AD 82–84. An area of prehistoric pasture land has yielded a number of lithics, and there is post-hole and pottery evidence of an early roundhouse on this level.\nNumerous prehistoric lithics and a small quantity of Roman and Romano-British pottery including sherds of amphora, a Romano-Celtic shrine, Romano-British pottery and a Roman bronze cavalry stud were also found.[9]\nMedieval period\nIt appears that sometime around the turn of the 11th century the raised areas of ground were moated and a timber Motte and Bailey fortress was established.[10] This complemented the existing Motte of Urr, further up the river. With the construction of this timber fortification and the large complex of buildings which sprung up around it, we see the proper beginnings of the Castle, which was to later be fortified in stone.[11]\nThe stone fortifications ca. 1200 eventually comprised the residential Motte (some 100 x 150 feet), where the Lords of Galloway had their private chambers as well as the major reception rooms necessary for the running of a semi-sovereign demesne, the Inner Bailey with its two-storey Keep, Chapel of Ease, and associated buildings, and the Outer Bailey, likely comprising workshops and servants dwellings, stabling, etc.[12] These eventually formed the primary seat of the Lords of Galloway, which Lordhip was eventually settled on Devorguilla, as the sole surviving heiress of Alan of Galloway.\nIt is difficult to understate Lady Devorguilla's influence during her lifetime, especially in her Lordship of Galloway which centred around her seat at Buittle. Her marriage to John de Balliol of Barnard Castle was a powerful alliance which only increased her status. In her own right she owned manors from France to Hitchin in Hertfordshire, and the coming together of the two great houses of Galloway and Balliol meant that the pair wielded an enormous amount of power. By all accounts, however, Devorguilla was noted for her piety and she and her husband ruled Galloway benevolently and with an eye to the public good.[13] It was likely under her auspices that the Chapel of Ease, now no longer extant, was built at Buittle, and it must be either this establishment or her promulgation of the Statutes of Balliol College, annotated 'apud Botel', which is connected to the discovery of a Papal Bulla of Honorius IV during the excavations on the bailey.[14]\nAlthough King John did try to rule in the example of his parents, his attempts to summon parliaments, and to put down lawlessness were not enough to stave off accusations of ceding too much power to King Edward of England, to whom he was greatly indebted for support during the Great Cause. When he was forced to rebel against English control of Scotland, his followers were roundly defeated by the English at the Battle of Dunbar (1296) after which he was stripped of the crown of Scotland by Edward I and became a prisoner of the English, never returning to Buittle Castle. The castle eventually fell to Robert the Bruce's forces in February 1313, under the command of his brother Edward Bruce. King Robert retained possession of Buittle until finally granting it to Sir James Douglas, Lord of Douglas. The Douglases retained possession until Edward Balliol, King John's son, was crowned in 1332 in his attempt to overthrow King Robert the Bruce's son, King David II, but his attempt failed miserably.[15] The new Lord of Douglas, Sir William, later Earl of Douglas, recaptured Buittle Castle for King David in 1352 and it once more reverted to the Douglases.[16]\nEdward built a stone and timber-framed Mansion House on the Bailey in preference to the Motte. It is likely at this time that the fortified, or Barmkin, Courtyard would have been established which is today attached to the Tower House, thereby making a more easily defended central nucleus of buildings. If Edward's father could have been said to be a failed King of Scots, he was nothing compared to Edward himself, who ceded the whole of Lothian to Edward III, King of England in thanks for his support in retaking the throne. In 1356, after a series of astonishing setbacks, he surrendered his claim to the Scottish Throne, and died in Doncaster a year later.[17][18]\nIn 1456 Buittle reverted to the Crown, as part of the James, 9th Earl of Douglas's forfeiture. It would seem that, at this time, James III of Scotland settled the Barony of Buittle on his Queen, Margaret of Denmark, as part of her dowry. Some time after, it was granted to the Maxwells, in whose hands it remained for the next 450 years.[19]\nGeorgian to 20th century - farming period\nWilliam, 15th Lord Maxwell, who, after his father's death, was affectionately called the 6th Earl of Nithsdale by the people of Galloway, participated in the Jacobite Rising of 1745, but, apart from suffering the indignities imposed on all Jacobite supporters, seems to have come away from the affair relatively unscathed. Like all Jacobites, he was no longer legally permitted to make repairs to fortified buildings. It is likely that, at this time, he closed the tower of Buittle Castle and unroofed it for tax purposes, putting the courtyard's other buildings to agricultural use. Munches House, a new mansion in the Neo-Classical Robert Adam style, became the seat of the Maxwells of Munches, Terraughty, and Buittle, a subsidiary line of the Lord's of Maxwell. Buittle, therefore, passed through this Maxwell line, but, with the more fashionable house at Munches as the seat of the consolidated estate. It was not until ca. 1820 that Buittle was re-roofed and inhabited by tenant farmers. The most famous of these late 18th-century Maxwells was John Maxwell of Terraughty, born at Buittle, and presumably the last resident of the castle before the move to Munches. He was immortalised in Robert Burns's birthday epistle to him, which begins:\n‘Health to the Maxwell's veteran Chief!\nHealth, aye unsour'd by care or grief:\nInspired I turn'd Fate's sibyl leaf\nThis natal morn;\nI see thy life is stuff o’ prief,\nScarce quite half-worn.’\nIn 1949 Desmond Herries-Maxwell disponed the lands of Buittle to smallholding dairy farmers the Barrowmans. Desmond Maxwell, and latterly his son Peter Maxwell, Lord Maxwell QC however, retained portions of the estate. In 1984 Lord Maxwell bequeathed the ruins of the ancient Motte unto ‘The Master and Scholars of Balliol College’. This historic conveyance marked the 720th anniversary of the founding of Balliol.\nRestoration and present day\nOld Place of Buittle\nThe current buildings, known during the farming period as Old Place of Buittle or Buittle Place [20] comprise the Barmkin Courtyard with its main building - a largely 16th century Tower House, as well as a printing workshop and other outbuildings in the grounds of the bailey. It would seem that the tower house with courtyard complex had become known as Buittle Castle at least until the buildings were given over to agricultural use in the 18th century, as witnessed by Grose, Cardonnel, MacGibbon and Ross, et al.[21][22][23] By about 1790 the tower was roofless but in the mid-nineteenth century it was re-roofed to serve as accommodation for farm workers when it became part of the neighbouring Munches estate, during which time the bartizan angle turrets were removed.[24] The buildings, therefore, provided a challenge for restoration as significant farm buildings and arrangements had been erected during this period, as well as significant historical features removed.\nThe site was sold in 1992 to Jeffrey Burn, an artist, historian and re-enactor, who started the restoration of the historic buildings, largely stripping away the alterations and accretions of the farming period.[25] Burn renamed the buildings 'Old Buittle Tower', seemingly the first time that this name was used in connection to the property. The current owners have reverted to the name used by Grose and Cardonnel of Buittle Castle, reflecting the continued occupation and history of the comprehensive site. This courtyard of the current castle contains the Talla-bìdh Tea Room, the Laigh or Great Hall, and B&B accommodation. In the vaulted undercroft of the tower is a chapel which regularly offers liturgical services according to the medieval Use of Sarum under the auspices of the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles. The grounds contain a variety of garden areas designed and installed to highlight periods in the site's history, including a sunken garden designed on 15th century models by Anne Jennings. The property comprising the bailey of Buittle Castle is now used as a private residence, B&B, and religious site. The ruinous Motte of the Motte and Bailey site remains in the possession of Balliol College, Oxford, and is positioned to the immediate east of the Bailey.\nCitations\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Buittle Place.\nhttp://archives.balliol.ox.ac.uk/History/buittle.asp\nOfficial website\n54°56′07″N 3°50′40″W / 54.9352°N 3.8445°W / 54.9352; -3.8445\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerlaverock_Castle",
    "text": "Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland\nCaerlaverock Castle is a moated triangular castle first built in the 13th century. It is located on the southern coast of Scotland, eleven kilometres (seven miles) south of Dumfries, on the edge of the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve. Caerlaverock was a stronghold of the Maxwell family from the 13th century until the 17th century, when the castle was abandoned. It was besieged by the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, and underwent several partial demolitions and reconstructions over the 14th and 15th centuries. In the 17th century, the Maxwells were created Earls of Nithsdale, and built a new lodging within the walls, described as among \"the most ambitious early classical domestic architecture in Scotland\".[1] In 1640 the castle was besieged for the last time by the Protestant Covenanter army and was subsequently abandoned. Although demolished and rebuilt several times, the castle retains the distinctive triangular plan first laid out in the 13th century. Caerlaverock Castle was built to control trade in early times.[2]\nThe castle, which is protected as a scheduled monument, is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland,[3] and is a popular tourist attraction.\nEtymology\nThe name Caerlaverock is of Brittonic origin.[4] The first part of the name is the element cajr meaning \"an enclosed, defensible site\", (Welsh caer meaning \"fort, city\").[4] The second part of the name may be the personal name Lïμarch (Welsh Llywarch),[4] or a lost stream-name formed from the adjective laβar, \"talkative\" (Welsh llafar, see Afon Llafar),[4] suffixed with –ǭg, \"having the quality of\",[4] or the adjectival suffix -īg.[4] The present form has been influenced by the Scots word laverock, \"skylark\".[4]\nHistory\nView of one of the northern towers of the old, early 13th-century castle\nThe present castle was preceded by several fortifications in the area: a Roman fort on Ward Law Hill and a British hill fort that was in use around 950. The chronicles in the 12th-century Annales Cambriæ state that King Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio died nearby at the Battle of Arthuret in 573. His death triggered his bard Myrddin Wyllt to go insane and retreat into the woods, an act that later inspired the character of Merlin in Arthurian legend.[5]\nThe Maxwell family can be traced back to Undwin and his son Maccus in the 11th century; Maccus gave his name to the barony of Maccuswell or Maxwell. His grandson, John de Maccuswell (d. 1241), was first Lord Maxwell of Caerlaverock. The Baronies of Maxwell and Caerlaverock then passed down through the male line, sometimes collaterally. Robert de Maxwell of Maxwell, Caerlaverock and Mearns (d. 1409) rebuilt Caerlaverock castle and was succeeded by Herbert Maxwell of Caerlaverock (d. 1420).\nThe earliest mention of the lands of Caerlaverock is around 1160, when they were granted to the monks of Holm Cultram Abbey.[1] Around 1220 Alexander II of Scotland granted the lands to Sir John Maxwell, making him Warden of the West March. Sir John Maxwell also served as Chamberlain of Scotland from 1231 to 1233,[1] and began work on the first castle at Caerlaverock. This castle was square in shape and was one of the earliest stone castles to be built in Scotland. It had a moat with a bridge facing north. Only the foundations and remains of a wooden enclosure around it remain.[6]\nThis early castle may have been incomplete when it was abandoned in favour of a rock outcrop some 200 metres (660 ft) to the north. It was here that Sir John's brother Sir Aymer Maxwell began construction of the present castle. Sir Aymer also served as Chamberlain in 1258–1260, and was Justiciar of Galloway in 1264.[1] In the 1270s the \"new\" castle was completed, and Herbert Maxwell, nephew of John Maxwell, occupied it.\nHistoric view of Caerlaverock Castle\nWhen the moat around the second castle was dug, the quarrying was probably a source of building stone for the castle.[7] While the gatehouse stands on natural rock, the rest of the castle was built on a clay platform created especially for the castle.[8]\nWars of independence\nIn 1299, the garrison of Caerlaverock attacked Lochmaben Castle which was held by English forces.\nSiege of Caerlaverock\nCaerlaverock Castle by J. M. W. Turner, c.1832\nThe castle from the south-west in 2016\nIn July 1300 King Edward I of England marched north with an army including eighty-seven of the Barons of England and several knights of Brittany and Lorraine, and besieged Caerlaverock. Those present on the English side included Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln; Robert FitzWalter; Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford; John, Baron Segrave; Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick; John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond; Patrick, Earl of March and his son; Prince Edward (the future Edward II); Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and his brother Henry; Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel; and Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham. The Maxwells, under their chief Sir Eustace Maxwell, mounted a vigorous defence of the castle which repelled the English several times. In the end, the garrison was compelled to surrender, after which it was found that only sixty men had withstood the whole English army for a considerable period.\nDuring the siege the English heralds composed a roll of arms in Old French verse, known as the Siege of Caerlaverock, in which each noble or knight present was named, his feats of valour described, and a poetic blazon of his armorial bearings given.[9][10][11][12]\nRecovery\nPossession of the castle was subsequently restored to Sir Eustace Maxwell, Sir Herbert's son, who at first embraced the cause of John Balliol, and in 1312 received from Edward II an allowance of £20 for the more secure keeping of the castle. He afterwards gave in his adherence to Robert Bruce, and his castle, in consequence, underwent a second siege by the English, in which they were unsuccessful. Fearing that this important stronghold might ultimately fall into the hands of the enemy, and enable them to make good their hold on the district, Sir Eustace dismantled the fortress, service and sacrifice for which he was liberally rewarded by Robert Bruce.\nBy 1337 the castle was once again inhabited, and Sir Eustace now changed sides again, giving his support to Edward Balliol. Around 1355 Sir Roger Kirkpatrick of Closeburn captured Caerlaverock for David II of Scotland, and partly dismantled the castle.[13]\nRepair and rebuilding\nView showing the latter addition to the castle at the north end of the Inner Court\nBy the end of the Wars of Independence in the mid-14th century, Caerlaverock had been regained by the Maxwells, with Sir Robert Maxwell rebuilding much of the castle between 1373 and 1410.[13] Further work was undertaken by Robert, 2nd Lord Maxwell, in the mid-15th century, probably involving reconstruction of the gatehouse. A new west range was added within the walls around 1500.[13]\nThe Catholic Maxwells took up the cause of Mary, Queen of Scots, after her forced abdication in 1567. Caerlaverock was besieged in 1570 by an English Protestant force led by the Earl of Sussex, and was again partly demolished, including the destruction of the gatehouse with gunpowder.[13]\nBy 1593, John, 8th Lord Maxwell was repairing the castle again, building up the gatehouse for defence against the Johnstones of Annandale, with whom the Maxwells were feuding.[13] The 8th Lord was killed by the Johnstones during a fight at Dryfe Sands, and in 1613 the 9th Lord Maxwell was executed for the revenge murder of Sir James Johnstone.\nEarls of Nithsdale\nIn 1619 Robert, 10th Lord Maxwell, married Elizabeth Beaumont, cousin of the Duke of Buckingham, a favourite of James VI of Scotland. He was subsequently made Earl of Nithsdale and appointed to the Privy Council of Scotland. To reflect his new status he built the elaborate south and east ranges within the castle, known as the Nithsdale Lodging.[13]\nCaerlaverock Castle in 1900\nThe new ranges were completed around 1634. Nithsdale was at Caerlaverock in August 1637, and wrote to Sir Richard Graham asking for dogs for hunting and breeding.[14] Religious turmoil soon turned against the staunchly Catholic Maxwells. In 1640 the Protestant Covenanter army besieged Caerlaverock for 13 weeks, eventually forcing its surrender. According to Sir Henry Vane, the Earl and Countess of Nithsdale and their page were allowed to leave, but 40 defenders called Maxwell were put to the sword.[15] The south wall and tower were demolished, and the castle was never repaired or reoccupied.[13]\nIn the mid 19th century, the castle was in the possession of William Constable-Maxwell, 10th Lord Herries of Terregles (1804–1876), heir of the 5th Earl of Nithsdale.[16]\nArchitectural description\nThe castle ground floor plan from MacGibbon and Ross, showing the ranges of the building.\nThe castle is most unusual in having a triangular form, one of only a small number across Europe and the only one in the UK. [17] As well, it is unusual for Scotland in having a moat and earthwork ramparts around it. It sits in a low lying formerly swampy area on the flood plain of the nearby River Nith, again unusual for a defensive structure in this area of Scotland. It is however, the finest example of a castle in south-west Scotland. [18]\nThe basic form is triangular, with the Gatehouse to the north formed of two large drum towers (see plan). In the south west and south east corners there are further but smaller drum towers. Murdoch’s Tower to the south west is largely complete, but the tower to the south east was reduced to base level during the Covenanter siege of 1640.\nDespite many sieges and slightings followed by rebuildings, the original form of the castle can still be appreciated, the curtain wall bases largely remaining at lower levels, these dating to the original construction in the last quarter of the thirteenth century (HES Statement of Significance op cit, p10) The early parts of the castle were built of red sandstone quarried at nearly Bankend. [19] While of later build, to the west and east much of the curtain walls stand to parapet height.\nWithin the courtyard formed by the curtain walls there are four ranges: the Gatehouse, the west range, the Banqueting Hall range and the Nithsdale Lodging range (see plan), a small triangular courtyard being formed between them. [20] These ranges are of different dates. Especially to the south, the buildings are ruinous, the Banqueting Hall range in particular being reduced for the most part to no more than a few metres high.\nA. The Gatehouse range is the earliest remaining part of the castle. It consists of the two massive drum towers faced in ashlar with the entrance passage between the towers. The west tower is largely original, but the east tower was largely rebuilt in the late fifteenth century. While ruinous at the upper levels, the drum towers still stand above the drawbridge to a height of some 15.5 metres to the machicolations, these dating to the late fifteenth century rebuild. Internally, the gatehouse has an entrance with portcullis and above a hall, later subdivided (Stell op cit, p112).\nB. The west range dates to around 1500 and while roofless is largely complete. The range consists essentially of a series of rectangular rooms on two floors, each with a fireplace, the rooms most likely used as accommodation (Stell op cit, p112.)\nC. The south or Banqueting House range was reduced to walls of only a few metres high or less, largely as a result of the Covenanter's siege in 1640, when artillery fire and then slighting reduced the walls (and at the same time the SE tower). The Hall was of substantial size, and some evidence of its former grandeur can be gauged from the remains of the large fireplace on the north wall.\nD. Sitting to the north east of the interior, and the last part of the castle to be built, the Nithsdale Lodging building is the most complete part of the castle. Although lacking its two eastern most bays it is perhaps the most spectacular part of the castle, with its magnificent Renaissance façade of the 1630s (SoS op cit, 12-13). The remaining front is decorated with a series of carved pediments over nine large windows, three smaller ones and two doorways, depicting various armorials and symbolic sculptures (SoS op cit, 16-18) . Internally, the rooms are quite small, due to the placement of a fireplace/flue block in the centre of the structure. With the kitchens and other service rooms on the ground floor, the rooms on the first and higher floors were most likely used as private apartments.\nNature reserve\nCaerlaverock Castle is within the Nith Estuary National Scenic Area, protected for its scenic qualities, with the castle recognised as a landmark of the area.[21] The castle is at the northern edge of the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve, which extends to 55 square kilometres (21 sq mi) and consists of saltmarsh, mudflats and grazing land. It is an internationally important wintering site for waterfowl and wading birds, including the barnacle goose.[22]\nCultural references\nThe castle was used as a location for the 2011 romantic comedy film The Decoy Bride.[23]\nReferences\nBibliography\nBrault, Gerard J., ed.

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruggleton_Castle",
    "text": "Castle in Scotland\nCruggleton Castle is a multi-period archaeological site on the coast of the Machars, in the historical county of Wigtownshire in south-west Scotland. It is located at Cruggleton Point, around 4.5 kilometres (2.8 mi) east of Whithorn and 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) south-east of Sorbie. Excavations in the 1970s and 1980s revealed several periods of use, from the 1st century AD to the 17th century. The first stone tower was built in the 13th century, on an earlier motte.\nThe castle is located on a high outcrop of shale, which forms a promontory on the east-facing cliff edge, about 40 metres (130 ft) above sea level. The name \"Cruggleton\" is taken to derive from the rocky nature of the site.[1]\nHistory of the site\nExcavations on the site revealed the remains of a late Iron Age hut circle, and of a timber hall dated to the early medieval period. During the 12th or 13th century, the rock outcrop was raised to form a motte and a timber tower was built. During this time, Cruggleton Castle was possibly a seat of the Lords of Galloway, passing to the Earls of Buchan. The earliest stone tower and curtain wall was built between the late 13th and early 15th centuries.[2] In the 1290s, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, had a licence from Edward I to dig for lead in the Calf of Man, to cover eight towers of the castle.[3] Cruggleton, also known as \"The Black Rock of Cree\", has been associated with the stronghold on the Water of Cree that William Wallace captured, with his companions Stephen of Ireland and Kerlé, according to Blind Harry.[4] It was again taken by Scottish forces in 1307 and subsequently demolished. Later in the 14th century, King David II granted Cruggleton to Gilbert Kennedy. In 1424 it was granted to the Prior and Canons of Whithorn.[5]\nIn 1563 the spies of Queen Elizabeth I of England visited south-west Scotland to examine the defences at Cruggleton, Wigtown, Cardoness and Kirkcudbright. They noted that Cruggleton \"is now kept but with 2 men only but when the Prior of Whithorn lies there then under 20 men without artillery.\" They also made a coloured drawing of the castle, now held by the British Museum, that shows a high tower, surrounded by a curtain wall with sloped merlons and defended by drawbridge and portcullis.[5]\nAfter the Reformation, church lands were distributed among the nobles of Scotland. A dispute arose over Cruggleton Castle between Lord Robert Stewart, Commendator of Whithorn Priory, and John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming, which was heard by the civil courts. Despite this in 1569 Stewart, an illegitimate son of James V, was besieged in the castle by Lord Fleming. James Stewart, Earl of Moray, also an illegitimate son of James V, interceded on his brother's behalf by writing to Sir Patrick Vaus of Barnbarroch, urging him to relieve the siege. The dispute was resolved in favour of Margaret Stewart, Mistress of Ochiltree, in the 1580s.[6]\nCruggleton was later held by Sir Patrick Vaus, who died in 1598. It passed to his son Sir John Vaus who disposed of the property to Peter McDowall of Machermore, who in turn sold it to James Kennedy in 1606. The castle passed through various owners during the following decades, but by 1684 it was described as \"wholly demolished and ruinous.\"[7]\nCruggleton ruins\nCruggleton Castle is accessible along a coastal path from the grounds of nearby Galloway House. Today the outward remains consist of a narrow section of barrel vaulting in what was the tower. It is known locally as 'The Arch' and is clearly visible from the B7063 Garlieston to Isle of Whithorn road. Formerly supported on metal bands, the stonework has recently been rebuilt (how recently?) and stands around 3 metres (9.8 ft) high. The foundations of several further buildings can be seen across the site. The outline of the motte is still clearly visible, measuring around 31 by 29 metres (102 by 95 ft), as is a broad ditch across the promontory, about 50 metres (160 ft) west of the ruins.[7][8] The remains are a scheduled monument.[9]\nCruggleton Church\nCruggleton Church is about 750 metres (2,460 ft) west of the castle and may indicate the approximate site of the village of Cruggleton. It was established in the early 12th century by Fergus, Lord of Galloway, and remains the most complete Romanesque church in the area.

It was sited by the River Nith, in the area now known as Castledykes Park.[1]\nA motte and bailey castle was built in the 12th century. The town was created a royal burgh by King William the Lion in 1186. The castle was enlarged and rebuilt in stone in 1214. King Alexander III of Scotland visited the castle in 1264 to plan an expedition against the Isle of Man. Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale captured the castle in 1286. The castle was occupied by the English from 1298. King Edward I of England stayed at the castle in 1300. Robert de Brus captured the castle briefly in 1306 from the English-appointed constable Richard Siward. King Robert I of Scotland captured the castle on 7 February 1313 from the English appointed constable, his enemy Dungal Macdouall, who had turned King Robert's brothers, Thomas and Alexander, over to Edward I, who promptly executed them. According to the RCAHMS there is \"a strong belief\" that it was destroyed after the capture and never rebuilt.[1]\nSee also\nTroqueer Castle\nKirkhill Castle\nCitations\n55°03′22″N 3°36′08″W / 55.0561°N 3.6022°W / 55.0561; -3.6022\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Dunskey Castle is a ruined, 12th-century tower house or castle, located 0.5 miles (0.80 km) south of the village of Portpatrick, Rhinns, Wigtownshire, on the south-west coast of Scotland.[1]\nDunskey Castle is a scheduled monument,[2] a 'nationally important' archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change.\nDunskey Castle\nDescription\nThe three-storey L-plan structure is sited on a promontory, with a rock-cut ditch, 15 metres (49 ft) wide by 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) deep, defending the only access, from the north-east.[3] The castle measures 30 by 14.3 metres (98 by 47 ft), with walls 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) thick, although the building is now a roofless shell. The north-east wing is of a later date, and the foundations of a south range are visible. Near the castle are the remains of a watchtower, 7 metres (23 ft) square, built on the cliff edge.[4] Timothy Pont's map drawn c. 1580 – 1590 shows Dunskay Castle with 2 watchtowers on the cliff edge fronting the sea.[5] Francis Grose's drawing dated show of 10 May 1790s the ruins of the foundations and sea-wall on the south, and what looks to be the large entrance door in the southern corner from where the inside staircase may have led straight up to the new \"Hall\" built c.1520. Grose's drawing shows Ireland (approx. Island Magee / Larne area) in the background across the sea.[6]\nIn virtue of a tradition preserved in the Book of Leinster, W. J. Watson identifies the place named in it as Port Rig (Portrie, Portree) with the later Portpatrick, connecting 'Rig' with Reregonium, which he regards as the royal town of the Novantae and places in this region. He would thus carry Portpatrick's history back to the first century of our era, while he dates a rather later reference to about AD 250.[7] Portpatrick was known as the port of Castle Dunskey.\nDunskey is undoubtedly romantic. It was a location for the 1951 film Kidnapped of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Double X: The Name of the Game (1992), as well as for the 1952 film Hunted.\nThe owner, Lady Amy McFall, restricts public access to the castle.\n13th and 14th centuries\nIn the 1290s, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, had a licence from Edward I of England, reigned 1272–1307) to dig for lead in the Calf of Man (off the coast of the Isle of Man), to cover eight towers of the Cruggleton Castle / Crogiltoun Castle in Wigtownshire. Was Dunskey Castle built about this time ?[8] and in 1291 the nearby Wigtown Castle was in the hands of the same Edward I who committed it to the charge of Walter de Currie or Cory / Corry / Coree (laird of Dunskey). King Edward I ultimately conferred Wigtown Castle (and Dunskey Castle ?) on John Balliol the Scottish King (reigned 1292-1296 after which Scotland was without a monarch for 10 years and Sir William Wallace fought the English in 1297, but was defeated at Falkirk in 1298).[9]\nBy 10 October 1303 Walter de Corry was dead and his lands were taken into the King's hands (King Edward I of England).[10][11][12][13]\nOn 28 August 1296 the Ragman Rolls for Wigtownshire had been compiled at Berwick-on-Tweed, which time and place King Edward I of England also convened a Parliament of those\nScottish nobles summoned by him to attend at the border city. The Wigtownshire roll contained 26 names, and some who were later associated with Dunskey Castle were Thomas de KITHEHILT (Adair of Kinhilt / Kilhelt); Fergus MakDowylt (MacDowell); Thomas MacUlagh (MacCullough / McCullagh); Andrew (McDowell) de Logan; Dougal MacDowly (MacDowell / McDowell); Gilbert de Hanneth (Hannay); William MacUlagh (MacCullough / McCullagh); Michel MacUlagh (MacCullough); Johan Seneschal (Stewart, from whom descended the Earls of Darnly and Lennox); Maria, Queen of Mann and the Isles.[14]\nc. 1326 \"Index of Charters, &c. by King Robert I.\" King Robert I Robert the Bruce (born 1274 reigned 1306-1329 after the Interregnum 1296-1306). p. 27 \"In the Roll of Robert the First, marked on the back with this mark, X. 1.

II index on p. 1134 BALLIVUS de Carrick, lists p. 94 no.414, 13 February 1450 Gilbert Kennedy of Dunure \"REX confirmavit Gilberto Kenedy de Dunure consang. suo, – quod ipse Gilbertus et heredes sui masculi essent caput totius progeniei sue tam in calumpniis quam in aliis articulis et negotiis ad KENKYNOLL pertinere valentibus; unaetum officio ballivi comitatus de Carric et hominum ipsius dectione et cum armorum ostensione in omnibus, sub comite de Carric qui pro tempore fuerit; – que idem Gilb. personaliter resignavit.\" iv. 182.[20] – was he a bailie & Kenkynol, as Exchequer Roll 1455 shows Gilberti Kenedy, BALLIVI comitatus de carric had ward of Kylnnahelt (Dunskey).[21]\nGilbert Kennedy of Dunure, bailie of Carrick, did not enjoy Dunskey Castle for long as in 1455, Exchequer Rolls of Scotland records that he was compensated for NOT having the ward of Adair.[22] If he was the same Gilbert, he married Christian Adair and her son, apparently Rolland Adair, must have come of age about 1456. Christian Adair Kennedy was a widow and Dunskey apparently was resigned by Gilbert Kennedy then shown as of Quhiltis which may have been \"White Hills\" next to/or Kilhilt / Kinhilt, to William Earl of Douglas[23] who in turn must have assigned it over to Rolland Adair when he came of age.\nIn 1457 the Exchequer Rolls, Vigtoun (Wigtownshire) listed \"Libri Responsionum\" notes that Rolandi Adair t. Gilhelt (Kilhelt) had sasine of Crecach, Dunnone, Pennyanach, Kildonan (Dunskey, o'wise Portree see p. 688), Carny, and Lochbeg (Laughbeg or Middle Laigh).[24] Carny is shown on Pont's map as \"Karn Multibrugh\" north of Lefnol (Leffnoll / Lesnoll / Lochnoll) and as \"Cairn\" on Ainslie's 1782 map of the County of Wigton, in the National Library of Scotland, digital library early maps[25]\nIn 1486 ADAIR (Adare), Rolland, deceased, father of William Adair (who must have been under-age) the ward of his lands of Kilhelt, Portre (Dunskey), Kildonane and Drummore, had been granted to an Alexander Bruce c.1468 who had had them in error for 18 years. p. 381 error of accounting for 18 years.[26]\nIn 1488 William Adair of Dunskey Castle & Kinhilt and McCulloch of nearby Ardwell, Stoneykirk, were attacked by sheriff Quentin Agnew of Lochnaw Castle and his band of men. Agnew was pursued before the Lords of Council and in 1489 Agnew had to pay for the goods taken, but was entitled to a rebate if he returned them in good order.[27]\nAbout 1489 Dunskey / Dunsky Tower House [ otherwise Castle ] was partially burnt by Sir Alexander (Sandy) M'Culloch of Myrtoun Clan McCulloch.[28] – 3 March 1499, pardon for McCulloch, along with respites for burning the Place of Dunskay granted to Duncane Makke, litil Gilbert Makke, Johne Clerk Makee & Andro Akersane.\nIn the early 1500s Dunskey Castle was repaired by the Adairs of Kinhilt (the Hall of Dunskey was rebuilt and was 36feet by 17feet).[29] The Adairs built the Castle of St. John in nearby Stranraer Wigtownshire about 1510.[30]Dunskey Castle by Francis Grose 1790[31]29 August 1496 \"Anent the complaynt made be Wilzeam Adaire of Kilhelt and Archibald Makculloch of Ardwell apoun Schir Alexander McCulloch of Mertoune, knicht Clan McCulloch, Owchtre McDowell of Gerthloy (Uchtred McDowell of Garthland) Clan Macdowall, and thare complicis, that quhair thai war dylatit of art and part of the slauchter of umquhile DYONYSE of Hammyltoun, quilkis was slane on Mydsummer evin that last was, in the toune of Wigtoun, thai bean innocent thareof, and was redy al tymes to underly our soverane Lordis lawis tharefore as was allegiit, quharefore the persons forsaid with thare complicis assegit the place of DUNSKAY pertenyng to the sade Wilzeam Adair and rasit fyre and byrnt the sammyn and skaithit the said Wilzeam in househald geire tharethrou, extending to the soume of xl li., throw the quhilk fyre rasing thai birnt ane box pertenyng to Elyse McCulloch quhilk thai had in keping and in it j li. and the skaith of the birnyng of the sade Wilzeam house extending to xx li., and als that thai tuke and spulzeit fra the sade Wilzeam foure horses with a part of barkit hydis, as was rychtsa allegiit, and als fra the sade Archbald McCulloch and his pure folkis insicht gudis of househald to the availe of xxx li., togidder with ix of ky and oxin, xviij of schepe, xvj horses and meris, tane be the sade Schir Alexander and his complicis as was inlikewise allegiit.\"[32]\nAfter September 1513 Ninian Adair of Kinhilt, as son and heir of William Adair who was killed at Flodden with McDowell, had Sasine (delivery of feudal property) of the estate.[33] Four years later Ninian had a renewal of the tack which had been granted to his father in 1512. It is said that Ninian Adair rebuilt the castle of Dunskey on a more magnificent scale than ever, and to put an end to the feud with the MacDowells he espoused Janet McDowell, a daughter of the house of Garthland Garthland Castle. The ground floor plan of Dunskey appears to show this new enlarged section (three cellars facing the land-side of Dunskey Castle with the \"new\" hall with a huge fireplace on the next floor).[34] The arched entrance appeared to be approximately at the south-eastern bottom corner room with circular steps leading up to the new hall. The archway to the entrance can be seen in Francis Grose's drawing, but only the top portion of the archway can now be seen. One peculiar aspect was that one of the new cellars or vaults appeared not to have had a door. Another aspect was \"...we went by water to see the ruins of an old castle (Dunskey), under this house, in the rock, is a cave, which, they say, goes a considerable distance under ground...\".[35] This cave may be shown in a photo of Dunskey Castle on Geograph.[36] There are other mentions of a piper \"ghost\" playing and pacing up and down perhaps in the cave.[37][38]\nIn 1520–1521 Ninian Adair had only a short time to enjoy his new additions to Dunskey Castle as in 1523 his son William was mentioned as his heir.[39] In 1520–1521 (as Ninian Adair's heir, William, was under-age) the warde his lands (including Dunskey castle) were put into the hands of the Gilbert Kennedy, 2nd Earl of Cassilis and Lord Maxwell.[40]\n17th century\nDunskey Castle from the north-east. photo by Anne Burgessc.1600 \"in Ninian Adair's time and his sons\" a browney \"hanted\" his house of Dunsky.[41][42]\nOn 5 April 1608 the lands of Guilielmus (William) Adair heir of Niniani Adair de Kinhilt, included 10 lib. terranium de Portrie cum castro de Dunskey in parochie de Inche Inch, Wigtownshire.[42][43] William Adair marriage contract 18 April 1580 to Rosina MacClellan of Galston whose brother, Sir Robert McClellan (McLellan) of MacLellan's Castle Kirkcudbright Clan MacLellan married 1614 Mary Montgomery, eldest daughter of Sir Hugh Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Ards, county Down, Ireland.[44]\nIn February 1620, \"10 librat of antiqui extentus de Portry\" including \"3 mercatas de Marok cum castro de Doneskey\" was acquired by Hugh Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery who extended the castle by building the \"Gallery\" leading off from the \"Hall\" and vaults under the \"Gallery\".[18]\nOn 24 August 1632 Sara Maxwell, Viscountess Montgomerie, wrote a letter to her husband, Hugh Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery (Montgomerie of Airds) \"It seameth ye ar causing your workmen goe on both in your building and theikine of your Gallerie att Dunskay.

    "text": "The 16th century Robgill Tower, since extended, perched on a hill overlooking the Kirtle Water\nRobgill Tower is a tower house near Kirkpatrick Fleming on the banks of the river Kirtle. It was one of a number of towers built along the border as protection against incursions by the English.[1]\nThe tower was owned for centuries by Clan Irvine, also spelled as Irving, but a report from 1834 indicates that it was owned by James Smail by that time. He had acquired it from Sir Emelius Irving.[2]\nEtymology\nThe name is from the Old English personal name Hreodbeorht (modern name Robert) and Old Norse gil \"ravine\". The name was recorded as Redbeilgill in 1125.\nHistory\nThe tower was probably built circa 1540 by the Irvine family who also owned Bonshaw Tower, but some documents indicate that it was built in 1430. Robgill Tower was the \"blue-print for Bonshaw Tower\" (3/4 of a mile distant) which was built in the same era.[3]\nThe Robgill tower was modified extensively in the 19th century. It has been B-listed since 1971. The Listing indicated that the structure - a medium scale mansion ... [with] crenellated retaining wall\" - was built in several phases primarily in the late 18th and early 19th century, although the nucleus was a 16th-century tower.[4]\nA subsequent report at the time indicated that there was a \"fine stable block dating from the later 19th C. and a sizeable walled garden with a large glasshouse. The stable block has gained a swimming pool and there is a large indoor equestrian arena\". The stable block is also Category-B listed[5][6] as are the Gate Lodge and Gate Peers. The Walled Garden is Category-C rated.[7]\nAn 1889 book about the architecture of Scotland states that about ten years earlier, the tower was modified: \"wilfully pulled down to the level of the hall floor\" to allow for a hall that would connect it to the new, adjoining, house that was being built.[8]\nA 1973 summary of the property indicated that the current owner was a Mr. Shaw.[9]\nA 2013 prospectus provided numerous diagrams, photographs and descriptions of each element of the property.[10] A 2019 summary stated that it had \"six reception rooms, an indoor swimming pool, a games room, gym, indoor riding arena, a six-car garage and a separate two-bedroom gate lodge\". The manor was restored recently and was said to have outstanding equestrian facilities\".[11][12]\nReferences\nRCHAMS\n55°2′1″N 3°10′39″W / 55.03361°N 3.17750°W / 55.03361; -3.17750\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle ruins in Scotland\nRuined tower of Sanquhar Castle Sanquhar Castle, now a ruin, was built in the 13th century; the ruins are situated north east of Dumfries overlooking the River Nith.[1] Situated on the southern approach to the former royal burgh of Sanquhar in Dumfries and Galloway, south west Scotland, it sits on the trail of the Southern Upland Way. The castle is a stronghold bounded on the west by the River Nith, to the north by a burn, and made strong by a deep ditch running the remainder of the boundary.\nHistory\nThe castle was built by the Ross family in the 13th century and then passed to the Crichton family in the 14th century.[2] In July 1617, James VI and I, visited the castle en route to Glasgow: the Crichtons welcomed him with a display so huge that it bankrupted them.[3] Sanquhar Castle was sold by the Crichtons in the mid 17th century to Sir William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry, who established the fairytale pink sandstone Drumlanrig Castle ten miles south of Sanquhar near Thornhill. From then on the castle at Sanquhar began to steadily crumble to a ruin, until 1895 when John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, purchased it and attempted to enthuse a restoration of his ancestral home, following successful restorations at Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch in Wales. This was undertaken by Robert Weir Schultz and the squarer and more structurally sound sections rebuilt at that time can clearly be identified.[4]\nWork ended following the death of the Marquess in 1900, and what is left of the site is a mix of restoration and original stonework, but still very far from any sense of completion. It is designated a scheduled monument.[5]\nReferences\nWorks cited\n\"Sanquhar Castle, Site Number NS70NE 3\". CANMORE. RCAHMS. Retrieved 19 August 2009.\nChisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). \"Sanquhar\" .

    "text": "Castle in Scotland\nTibbers Castle is a motte-and-bailey castle overlooking a ford across the River Nith in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. To the east is the village of Carronbridge and to the north west is a 16th-century country house, Drumlanrig Castle.[1]\nPossibly built in the 12th or 13th century, Tibbers was first documented in 1298 at which point the timber castle was replaced by a stone castle. It was the administrative centre of the barony of Tibbers until the second half of the 14th century when it shifted to nearby Morton. During the Anglo-Scottish Wars of the early 14th century the castle was captured by first the Scots under Robert the Bruce and then the English, before returning to Scottish control in 1313.\nThe castle descended through the Earls of Moray and subsequently the Earls of March before coming under the control of the Scottish Crown. A 'toun' was established near the castle. While it is unclear at what point Tibbers Castle fell out of use, by the 18th century the site was used for agriculture. Archaeological investigations took place in 1864, 1912, and 2013–2014.\nHistory\nEdward I of England visited Tibbers Castle in 1298.\nThe origin of Tibbers Castle is undocumented, and it may have been founded in the 12th or 13th century as a timber castle. It was first recorded in 1298 when Sir Richard Siward, either built the stone enclosure castle or enhanced one which had already been added to the timber structure.[2] King Edward I of England visited the castle the same year.[3] Siward was the Sheriff of Dumfries when the area was under the control of the English and documentation from this period gives some evidence for activity at the castle. In 1302, £100 was spent on the structured while it was manned by a 23-strong garrison.[1]\nThe death of Alexander III of Scotland in 1286 led to a succession crisis resulting in English rule of Scotland under Edward I. Robert the Bruce's family was one of the claimants and in 1306 he was crowned king, leading to war with England.[4] The first phase of Bruce's campaign in 1306 was to capture the English-held castles of Ayr, Dalswinton, Inverkip and Tibbers.[5] Control was given to John de Seton until the English recaptured the castle from the Scots,[6] hanging the defenders,[3] and a larger garrison, this time numbering 54, was installed. In 1313 the Scots regained control of the region. From there Tibbers Castle remained in Scottish hands, and was possessed by Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray. He was succeeded by Thomas Randolph, 2nd Earl of Moray and John Randolph, 3rd Earl of Moray. When John died at the battle of Neville's Cross in 1346 the earldom along with Tibbers Castle was given to Patrick, Earl of March. His son inherited in 1369 and acquired the barony of Morton which probably became the administrative centre for the barony of Tibbers. The estates descended through the Dunbar family until 1435 when their lands were confiscated by the Scottish Crown. In 1450 or 1451, King James II of Scotland subsequently gave Tibbers to George Crichton, Lord High Admiral of Scotland and later the 1st Earl of Caithness. When he died in 1454 the property again came under royal control.[6]\nA 'toun' or township at Tibbers was mentioned in 1451, and the presence of the castle did not prevent the town from being attacked by Sir Alexander Stewart of Garlies in 1547.[7] It is unclear when Tibbers Castle fell out of use, but in the 18th century, the ridge on which the castle sits was used to grow crops.[8] Part of the structure was demolished to reuse materials such as lime.[9] The \"Mote de Tibbris\" is mentioned in the Registrum Magni Sigilli in 1489 and 1541.[10]\nThe interpretation of Tibbers has changed over time, and in the 18th century it was thought to be a Roman fort though it was later understood to be a medieval castle.[11] The name of the castle led to the suggestion that it derived from Tiberius Caesar,[3] however 'Tibbers' comes from the Gaelic word 'Toibar' meaning a well.[1] The earliest recorded excavation at Tibbers Castle took place in 1864, which recovered two coins from the reign of Edward II of England (1307–1327) and a dagger from the early 15th century. The site was surveyed in 1912 with no further archaeological investigation until the 21st century.[12] It was designated as a scheduled ancient monument in 1937.[13] In 2013 and 2014 the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland carried out measured and geophysical (using resistivity and a gradiometer) surveys at Tibbers with funding from Historic Scotland and the Castle Studies Trust.[14]\nLayout\nOccupying a ridge on the west bank of the River Nith, the earliest phase of the castle consisted of a small bailey or enclosure. This bailey was revealed by the geophysical survey in 2014 which also indicated that it contained timber buildings.[15]\nWhen Richard Siward remodelled the castle c. 1298 it is likely that he added the motte with its stone enclosure castle and replaced the single small bailey with two large enclosures south of the motte. These enclosures may have housed a market as was the case at Lochmaben Castle.[16] There are few examples in Scotland of earthwork castles being rebuilt in stone. The four-sided motte measures 44 by 27 metres (144 by 89 ft) at the summit. The enclosure castle on top is roughly rectangular, measuring 26.8 by 11.6 metres (88 by 38 ft), with a round tower at each corner. Little survives above ground of this structure, though the south-south-east tower survives best. The south side of the enclosure castle had an additional tower which tower with the south-south-east corner tower flanked the entrance. Inside, the castle had a well on the east side and a range of buildings extending along the west and north sides; these likely contained a great hall, the kitchens, and a chamber.[17] There was a postern gate just south of the north-east tower.[18] This phase of Tibbers is \"one of the few authentic surviving remnants of English castle building in Scotland during the Plantagenet occupation.\"[19]\nAt its greatest extent Tibbers Castle measured 330 metres (1,080 ft) by 85 metres (279 ft). The courtyard of the enclosure castle is the inner bailey. The outer and outermost baileys each cover an area of about 0.4 hectares (0.99 acres). The ramparts enclosing the site survive to a height of 0.5 metres (1 ft 8 in) and are between 3.4 and 5.5 metres (11 and 18 ft) wide.[20] Double baileys are uncommon, with examples at Windsor and Llandinam.[21]\nSee also\nList of castles in Scotland\nMorton Castle\nReferences\nBibliography\nBarrow, G.

In 1544 the castle was attacked by Michael Lord Carlyle and sacked, in his raid against his sister-in-law, Jonet Scrimgeour. She was reinstated by Regent Arran - James Hamilton, Earl of Arran - and the legal settlement includes a list of the contents of the Castle in the Scots language, and the farmstock in Latin.[1] Michael Lord Carlyle retained the castle until the latter decades of the sixteenth century.\nDouglas family\nSee also: Clan Douglas\nIn 1609 the ownership of the castle passed from Michael Carlyle to his half brother Douglases of Parkhead since then became property of the Douglas family, the last resident of the castle was Archibald Douglas of Dornock whom lived there until 1630.\nRuins and restoration\nThe roof of the castle was removed in the eighteenth century, after it the Torthorwald castle drifted into ruin, during the next century efforts were made to stabilise its structure. In 1993 the north end of the tower collapsed.\nThe basement and first floor hall of this tower are vaulted and in one corner is a turnpike stair that leads to the upper floors.

    "text": "Dudhope Castle from the east\nDudhope Castle: ideal restoration\nArtist's impression of Dudhope Castle in the early 19th century.\nDudhope Castle is an extended late medieval tower house located on the southern face of Dundee Law in Dundee, Scotland.\nHistory\nConstruction and private ownership\nThe castle was originally built in the late 13th century by the Scrymgeour family, with the original castle being a smaller tower house.[1] This was replaced around 1460.\nJames V visited in April 1540.[2] The castle was further extended in 1580[3] for James Scrimgeour and Magdalen Livingstone to its current L-plan structure with additional circular \"angle\" towers, although these were demolished in the 18th century. Some dormer or storm windows had stone pediments dated \"1600\", with the initials \"DML\" for Dame Magdalen Livingstone.[4] James VI and I stayed at Dudhope on 20 May 1617.[5]\nOn the death in 1668 of John Scrimgeour, 13th [6] (or 14th)[7] Constable, and first Earl of Dundee, King Charles II ignored the existence of the rightful heir, John Scrimgeour of Kirkton, and made a grant of Dudhope Castle and the office of Constable to Charles Maitland, a younger brother of the 1st Duke of Lauderdale.\nLater, when in financial difficulty, Maitland sold Dudhope Castle in 1684 to John Graham of Claverhouse, better known to most as \"Bonnie Dundee\".[8] It was from Dudhope Castle that he departed for Killiecrankie in 1689; the victory which resulted in his death. In 1694, the King therefore made a grant of Dudhope Castle to Archibald Douglas. The Douglas family were thus the last family of occupants of the castle as this continued until about 1790.[6] The history of Dudhope and the Constables are therefore inextricably interwoven with the history of Dundee. In fact, the two are inseparable. The office of Constable and occupancy of Dudhope Castle was held by four different families, as above, of which the Scrymgeours held the post for some 370 years.[6][7][9]\nOther uses of the castle\nIn 1792 the castle was rented in an attempt to use it as a woollen factory, although the plan never came to fruition. In 1795 the park and the grounds were leased to the Board of Ordnance, who used Dudhope as a barracks for 95 years, from 1796 to 1879. Additional buildings were constructed, including a hospital, officers quarters, stables and guard-rooms. The castle building itself was used as accommodation for 400 soldiers. The Board of Ordnance finally abandoned the castle in 1881.[10]\nIn 1854 the town council of Dundee acquired a sub-lease on the castle grounds, for use as recreational facilities. The lease ran for 351⁄2 years for an annual rent of £25 until 1 November 1890. At this time the Earl of Home had intended to develop the grounds into terraced housing.\nInstead the council acquired the grounds for £31,700, raising £20,000 itself and the remaining being raised from generous citizens by Lord Provost Mathewson. The grounds were opened as a park on 28 September 1895 by Sir James Low.[10]\nThe building was later occupied by the Ministry of Works and was used as a military barracks during both the 1914–18 war and the 1939–45 war. A time gun was formerly located in the grounds of the castle and fired daily at 1pm. It ceased to be used in 1916 so as not do disturb patients at the nearby Dundee Royal Infirmary who were suffering from shell-shock.[11]\nRedevelopment\nThe castle passed to the corporation of Dundee who made an attempt to demolish the castle in 1958. In the years 1985 to 1988 the castle was redeveloped and is now in use as offices, a conference centre as well as housing the University of Abertay Dundee's Dundee Business School.[1] During restoration, one of the main rooms was designated as the Scrimgeour room. It is furnished with wall hangings pertinent to the Scrimgeours and the drapes on the windows are made from material in the Scrimgeour tartan as arranged by the Scrimgeour Clan Association that was officially organized on 5 June 1971. In March 1998 a special dinner was held by the Clan Association in memory of the 700th anniversary of a charter to the Scrimgeours signed by William Wallace on 29 March 1298 and later reaffirmed in another charter signed by Robert the Bruce on 5 December of that same year.\nReferences\nExternal links\nClan Scrimgeour\n56°27′52″N 2°59′2″W / 56.46444°N 2.98389°W / 56.46444; -2.98389\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

During the Scottish Wars of Independence it was held by the governor Sir Gilbert de Carrick (Gille Brighde) who surrendered it to the English. It was soon recovered by the forces of King Robert I of Scotland. In 1206 the Corrie family were the hereditary keepers of Castle Loch Doon, and 57 years later, owing to the marriage of Sir Robert Corrie to Lady Susanna Carlisle, added greatly to their possessions in Dumfriesshire. The castle later fell to the English and was re-captured in 1214. The castle was besieged in 1335. During the 14th century the castle was in the hands of the Kennedy family. The castle was taken from them by William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas after a siege in 1446. Having been given back to the Kennedy family the castle was again taken from them by William Crauford of Lefnoris in 1511. The castle was destroyed in the 16th century by King James V of Scotland as part of a general policy of reducing the power of the barons of Galloway.\nThe castle was dismantled and rebuilt on the side of the loch after the loch water level was raised in the 1930s for a hydro-electric scheme.[4]\nCitations\nExternal links Media related to Loch Doon Castle at Wikimedia Commons\nLoch Doon or Balliol Castle, East Ayrshire - Video footage of Loch Doon or Balliol Castle on YouTube\n55°13′26″N 4°22′42″W / 55.2238°N 4.3784°W / 55.2238; -4.3784\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Human settlement in Scotland\nRiccarton is a village and parish in East Ayrshire, Scotland. It lies across the River Irvine from Kilmarnock, this river forming the boundary between Riccarton and Kilmarnock parishes, and also between the historical districts of Kyle and Cunningham.[1] The name is a corruption of 'Richard's town', traditionally said to refer to Richard Wallace, the uncle of Sir William Wallace.[2] The parish also contains the village of Hurlford.[1]\nHistory\nThe village became a Burgh of Barony in 1638, but its civic powers were never exercised. Riccarton is also sometimes called Ellerslie.[3] In 1875 Riccarton had a population of 1889,[4] but by 1951 that had increased to between 7000 and 8000; many of whom were employed at the Glenfield Works in Kilmarnock.[5]\nRiccarton has effectively been absorbed into Kilmarnock, partly through the growth of council housing estates at Shortlees, Witchknowe and Burnpark, and later by the improvements to the A71 (T) road, the building of which, together with associated interchanges, effectively made the old village centre into a large traffic island.\nThe Barony of Riccarton\nThe ancient 109 merkland barony included 54 separate landholdings, including the coalheughs of Riccarton and all the buildings, orchards, woods, mills, and fishings (salmon and others). Riccarton and Shaws mill were included. Also the £17 lands of Kaimshill, Auchindinane and Hunthall, oddly also the £5 land of Elderslie in Renfrewshire, the 4 merklands of Inchgotrig and the 2 merklands of Holme.[6]\nThe churches\nA pre-reformation Riccarton parish church stood in the centre of the old burial ground; first noted, as a chapel, in 1229, sub-ordinate to the church of Dundonald.[7] It was granted by Walter, High Steward of Scotland, to the short-lived independent Gilbertine convent of Dalmulin. This convent was dissolved in 1238, and the 'chapel' given to the monastery of Paisley, becoming the parish church, which still belonged to the monks. The last patrons were the Cuninghames of Caprington, whose impressive memorial still stands; some of the Campbells of Treesbank are also interred here.[8][9] The old cemetery in 2007 Detail of memorial to Caprington Cuninghames. A memorial to Caprington Cuninghames. A memorial bearing a bodkin, shears and an iron.\nThe old cemetery has a number of interesting pre-reformation style gravestones, ornamented with scenes of men ploughing with oxen, one with a bodkin, shears and iron, another with millstones, wheels, and other gearing, and even a few with Garden of Eden scenes. The oldest discernible stone is marked 1641.[10] Unfortunately many are very worn and heraldic devices, etc. can no longer be made out with any certainty.\nFrom the presbytery records it would appear to have been rebuilt in 1725.[11] It was replaced by the present church (at NS 4282 3639) in 1823, which was built on the old Judgement or Moot hill of the barony of Riccarton. Of the old church in the small churchyard nearby, nothing now remains above ground, the stones being used to build a single story house close to the old bridge.[12]\nThe manse no longer exists, however it had a claim to significance in that it had a mantelpiece in its kitchen which came from the dining room of Riccarton castle.[13]\nSawney Moodie\nAlexander Moodie (1728–1799) was the Auld-Licht Protestant minister of Riccarton lampooned by Robert Burns. Burns has him preaching with hell-fire roaring, enough to send the Devil himself back to his hot hell in fright.[14] He was educated at Glasgow University and starting his ministry at Culross in 1759. He was buried in the Riccarton churchyard, but the present church wasn't built until 1823.[15]\nAlexander had a hyperactive and deafening preaching style.[16] Burns also references him in the Holy Fair[16] with :\nHis lengthen'd chin, his turned-up snout,\nHis eldritch squeel an' gestures,\nO how they fire the heart devout..\nThis was followed by a lampooning in \"The Kirk's Alarm\" where his swarthy complexion earned him the title of Singet Sawnie.[16] Burns wrote The Holy Tulzie in 1784 in response to a verbally violent dispute over parish boundaries between Alexander Moodie and the John Russel, minister of Kilmarnock's High Kirk.\nLocal worthies and eccentrics\nThe house built at the old bridge from the ruins of old Riccarton Kirk.\nGilbert de Grimsby was born at Riccarton and would have known William Wallace during his childhood. Gilbert's Scots nickname was 'Jop' and as a man of great stature and generally impressive appearance he was chosen by Edward I to carry the sacred banner of Saint John of Beverley at the head of the English army at the Battle of Dunbar in 1296 after voluntarily joining the English army. He had served under Edward in Flanders and Picardy and had been selected as a pursuivant or herald. On hearing of William Wallace's insurrection Gilbert deserted Edward and joined William's rebellion, bringing invaluable intelligence about the English army and being rewarded with the position of standard-bearer.[17]\nRiccarton Inn from the old cemetery.\nParts of Riccartoun with Kilmarnock in 1880.[18]\nThe Rev. Alexander Moodie, minister of the parish, is buried in the old cemetery. Robbie Burns mentions him in The Holy Fair.[19]\nSandy McCrone was a blind fiddler who is remembered for having climbed to the top of the new church when the scaffolding was still in place and placed a potato on the beak of the weathercock.[20]\nWilliam Stevenson was a local beggar who came from Dunlop. About 1787 he separated from his wife and made the unusual pledge that if either of them were to make an attempt at reconciliation then that person was to pay the other a £100; a considerable sum in those times. When he died it was found that he was worth around nine hundred pounds. He set aside money for all the beggars in Ayrshire to come and see his body lying in state and then enjoy a great feast in his honour.[21]\nSir James Shaw, Bart., a Lord Mayor of London was born at Mosshead farm on the Treesbank estate in 1764.[22] His statue now stands outside the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock.[23] Sir James endeared himself to Scotland by the active part which he took in raising money in London for the widow and children of Robbie Burns.[24]\nThe Seat of Judgement\nThe present 1823 parish church of Riccarton stands on a mound which is partly natural and partly artificial and which was formerly called \"Seat of Judgement\", having been a court or moot hill where justice was administered by the old baron court of Riccarton. Paterson in 1863 called it the \"Moat.\"[8][25] Soil from the foundations of the new church on the old moot hill was used to fill up part of the river bed when its course was changed at East Shaw Street, and this area though north of the Irvine still lies in Riccarton parish.[26] Witchknowe is an area of Riccarton named after a low hill. No definite site for the 'Gallow's hill' associated with the Moot hill has been identified and this is a candidate, together with the 'Castle hill.'\nThe 'Castle Hill' in 1895 was a round-topped mound with an oval base close to Damhead House. It was 26 paces in its longest diameter at the base, 15 feet (4.6 m) high on one side and 4-foot-6-inch (1.37 m) on the other. It was covered with trees and had a seat and a path to the top.[27]\nRiccarton Castle and the Sir William Wallace connection\nMain article: Bickering Bush\nYardside farm to the left was the site of Riccarton castle. The boys on Riccarton green are playing a game of the Scots and the English.[2]\nThe name Wallace was spelled in various ways, such as 'Waleys', 'Walensis', 'Walays', etc.[3] The family were the barons of Riccarton and it is said that Wallace's father was born here. Some go so far as to suggest that William Wallace himself was born in Riccarton.[28] After his murder of Selby, Governor of Dundee, William Wallace first sought refuge in Riccarton castle; another time being after he had revenged his uncle's death at the Barns of Ayr.[29]\nA little below the watermeetings[30] of the Irvine and the Kilmarnock Water took place a pivotal incident in 1297[31] which led to the Scottish Nation regaining its independence following what was effectively its conquest by Edward I of England.\nSir William Wallace was fishing on the Irvine at Monksholm also Maxholm farm,[32] about half a mile to the west of old Riccarton castle,[33] when a troop of English soldiers dismounted and demanded that he give up his catch. He offered to share, but this was refused and he was grossly insulted by the soldiers for his temerity. He had no weapons, however he used his fishing rod to disarm one soldier and then killed him with his own sword. He similarly dispatched two others and the remaining soldiers then fled. The Bickering Bush commemorated the site of the incident until the 19th century.\nHe went to his uncle's castle, the nearby Riccarton castle and took on the disguise of a woman working at her spinning-wheel, thereby eluding the vengeful English troops.[20] In the following months an uprising slowly gained impetus through the example of one unarmed Scotsman killing three armed soldiers.[30] A thorn tree called the \"Bickering Bush\" stood nearby and its site is marked on the 1860 OS map and a public house by that name used to stand in Riccarton, although another still exists in Bonnyton, Kilmarnock.[34][35]\nJohn Wallace of Riccarton married the heiress of Craigie Castle and this became the principal residence, the old castle being allowed to fall into ruins.[36] In 1875 all that remained of the castle was some stately trees, including a pear tree supposedly planted by William Wallace.[32]\nDeath at Riccarton's Nether ford\nAt the Nether Ford on the Irvine near Riccarton, Robert the Bruce in 1307 sent Sir James Douglas[37] to intercept the English soldiers commanded by Sir Philip de Mowbray. The English were ambushed as they crossed the ford on the Irvine and sixty lay dead before the survivors fled. Views of Riccarton kirk The old judgement hill at Riccarton, now topped by a church.

A milestone at the lazy corner near the parish kirk with directions to Kilmarnock, Hurlford, Galston and Ayr.[38][39] The Parish kirk on the moot hill.\nRiccarton old bridge\nRiccarton old bridge.\nRiccarton Bridge is an 18th-century 3-span, segmental arched bridge, with dressed stone arch rings, rubble spandrels and triangular cutwaters.[40] The bridge was widened in 1806. The first recorded wheeled vehicles to be used in Ayrshire were carts offered gratis to labourers working on Riccarton Bridge, Kilmarnock, in 1726, and even then some of the labourers refused them.[41][42] The 1860 OS map shows that stepping stones crossed the River Irvine just upstream of the old bridge and just before the confluence of the Kilmarnock water with the river Irvine. The 'New' Riccarton Bridge lies just downstream and dates from 1839 and was also widened.\nThe Toll Road\nRiccarton parish was often in dispute with the Kilmarnock to Cumnock committee over the payment of so-called 'conversion' money for the Toll Road maintenance. Even after recourse to law the committee still failed to obtain any money from Riccarton and Galston parishes.[43]\nRiccarton mill and cottages\nRiccarton Mill in the 1860s.\nAt Map reference: NS 4463 3701 lies the old Riccarton mill with its associated cottages. The mill wheel has gone and the building has been converted into a private house.[44] One miller was named Goudie and his son was likewise a miller in Alloway until he took a lease on Burns's Cottage and ran it as a pub.[45]\nRiccarton Institute\nJohn Galloway, Esq., of Barleith and Dollars Collieries built an institute in New Street Riccarton for the use of the working-men in the locality. The building still survives as a Community Centre run by East Ayrshire Council.[46]\nRiccarton and Craigie railway station\nThe branch leading towards the Scotfuels Depot\nMain article: Riccarton and Craigie railway station\nThe village had a railway station by this name on the Gatehead and Hurlford branch of the Glasgow and South Western Railway. Part of the line remains open to supply a petrol depot in Kilmarnock. The remains of the station were extant until the new Kilmarnock bypass removed all traces. It was a goods only station (no passengers) as the line never had a publicly advertised passenger service. It is listed in 1929 as 'Riccarton and Craigie' by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, one of the stations which the company conveyed goods to.[47] It closed officially on 5 July 1965, originally just called Riccarton and renamed in 1905.[48]\nBellfield Estate\nThe old walled garden.\nThis grand Georgian mansion and its 240 acres (0.97 km2) of woodlands and gardens, including a notable rock garden, were given to Kilmarnock by the Misses Buchanan, Elizabeth, Jane and Margaret, in around 1879. The ladies were the daughters of George Buchanan, a Glasgow merchant.[49] Bellfield housing scheme borders it.[50]\nThe Buchanan Bequest was donated by the Buchanan Family from Bellfield House. It contains only 100 titles, from the original 1,500 books donated, dating from 1759 to 1856; these can be found in the Ayrshire Collection at the Dick Institute. The Museum Service also has a number of items, including those on history, biographies, dictionaries, reference works, periodicals, general literature, poetry & theology, industry, agriculture & natural history, travel, topography & illustrated works.[51]\nIn the 1900s Walls[52] recalled that the Bellfield Park, adjoining, the beauty and beneficience of which touches every heart. Here flowers and plants are grown to perfection and every shrubbery cultivated and tree pruned to a nicety.\nThe house was demolished in 1970, much of the land was used for building council housing and the remainder is now used as a public park and playing fields.[49] Views of Bellfield in 2007 Woodlands near the old mansion house.

The Todgrige burn runs from near Muirmill Equestrian centre to join the Irvine at the Caprington Castle estate. Ainslie's map of 1821 shows a loch near Earlston, with a farm named Lochside.[53]\nCoal and limestone mining\nCoal existed in great abundance and was mined from a very early date. Anthracite or blind coal was chiefly mined and limestone was quarried for use as a 'manure' on the fields as well as for making mortar.[7]\nWhitehill Loch\nWhitehill or Hillhouse loch was located in a glacial kettle-hole above Whitehill Farm and although largely drained by the early 18th century it was used a curling site in the 19th century. A dwelling, now demolished, called Lochouse sat on the loch's outflow into the Little Sorn Burn.\nMicro-history\nIn 1848 James Young from the farm or small holding at Knowehead was murdered near Fortacres Farm by James McWheelan. He was killed whilst returning to the farm after a visit to his parents and family at Knowehead.\nRiccarton is also a locality to the south-west of Edinburgh, the site of Heriot-Watt University's main campus\nRiccarton Junction railway station was on the Waverley Route line built by the North British Railway. It closed in 1969.\nMr & Mrs. Campbell from Treesbank attended the Eglinton Tournament of 1839.[54]\nThe 'Peace and Plenty' was a tavern on the road to Ayr near Treesbank, sitting amongst a group of cottages. The pub and cottages have long gone, however the name remains. The publican was famous for providing a free kebbuck of cheese and a scone with lunchtime pints; a custom that was quite prevalent in various parts of Scotland and England up until the 1914-1918 war.[55]\nTemple Riccarton, Temple Croft, and Temple Easter Knowhead were parts of the Lainshaw, Kirkwood, and Bridgehouse Estate. The estate had rights of peat extraction from Riccarton Moss.[56]\nNotable residents\nJohn Deans, pioneer farmer in Canterbury, New Zealand[57]\nAlexander Allan Stevenson, Canadian businessman, politician and military officer\nSee also\nBlacksyke Tower\nCaprington Loch\nCraigie Castle, Ayrshire\nEarlston, East Ayrshire\nRiccarton, New Zealand\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Riccarton, East Ayrshire.\nRock Gardens - Bellfield Estate, Kilmarnock\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Fortress in Scotland\nDirleton Castle is a medieval fortress in the village of Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland. It lies around 2 miles (3.2 km) west of North Berwick, and around 19 miles (31 km) east of Edinburgh. The oldest parts of the castle date to the 13th century, and it was abandoned by the end of the 17th century.\nBegun in around 1240 by John De Vaux, the castle was heavily damaged during the Wars of Scottish Independence, when it was twice taken by the English. In the 14th century, Dirleton was repaired by the Haliburton family, and it was acquired by the Ruthvens in 1505. The Ruthvens were involved in several plots against Mary, Queen of Scots, and King James VI, and eventually forfeited the castle in 1600. Dirleton ceased to be a residence, although Oliver Cromwell was forced to besiege the castle to flush out a band of \"mosstroopers\" (marauders), during the Third English Civil War in 1650. The damaged castle was then acquired by John Nisbet, Lord Dirleton, who decided to build a new country house on the nearby Archerfield Estate. The Nisbet family of Dirleton continued to maintain the castle's gardens, before handing Dirleton into state care in 1923. The ruins and gardens are now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland.\nDirleton Castle stands on a rocky outcrop, at the heart of the rich agricultural lands of the barony of Dirleton, and guards the coastal approach to Edinburgh from England, via the port of North Berwick. The ruins comprise a 13th-century keep, and a 16th-century house which the Ruthvens built adjacent. Only the basement levels survive of the 14th- and 15th-century additions built by the Haliburtons, although these comprised a large hall and tower house along the east range. Other buildings within the courtyard have also been demolished. Surrounding the castle are gardens, which may have been first laid out in the 16th century, although the present planting is largely of the 20th century. The garden walls enclose a 16th-century doocot, or pigeon house.\nHistory\nde Vaux\nArms of de Vaux, Vaus, Vass, Vauss, etc., Latinised to de Vallibus, lairds of Dirletoun: Argent, a bend gules. De Vaux, Baron of Gilsland in Cumberland, bore arms: Argent, a bend checqy or and gules[1] Reconstruction drawing, by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, of the Château de Coucy, which probably influenced the design of Dirleton\nThe Norman family of de Vaux originated in Rouen, northern France, and settled in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066. Two de Vaux brothers, or cousins, were among a number of Anglo-Norman knights invited to Scotland, and granted land, by King David I of Scotland in the 12th century. Hubert de Vaux was given the barony of Gilsland in Cumbria, at that time part of Scotland, while John de Vaux was granted the barony of Dirleton. John built a castle at Eldbotle, probably to the north-west of modern Dirleton, and another, named Tarbet Castle, on the island of Fidra, although neither survives.[2]\nIn 1220, Fidra was gifted to the monks of Dryburgh Abbey by William de Vaux.[3] William's son, another John, had been held hostage in England as surety for the good conduct of King William the Lion in 1213, and succeeded to the barony in the 1220s.[3] He then began the construction of a replacement for Tarbet at Dirleton, which was recorded as a \"castellum\" in 1225,[4] although this may refer to an earlier timber structure.[5] In 1239, de Vaux was appointed seneschal, or steward, to Marie de Coucy, on her marriage to King Alexander II. Marie de Coucy was the daughter of Enguerrand III, Lord of Coucy (d.1242), builder of the Château de Coucy, in Picardy (c.1220s), which probably served as a model for Dirleton.[6] The 13th-century stone castle, of which only the donjon, or keep, remains, represented a show of de Vaux's status, and would have required peaceful times to permit a prolonged construction project.[7]\nPeaceful times ended in 1296, with the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence. Dirleton, which guarded the route between Edinburgh and the English border, changed hands several times through the invasions of the English under King Edward I. During the campaign of summer 1298, the castle was besieged by English forces under Antony Bek, the Bishop of Durham.[8] Dirleton withstood the assault for several months, until the English victory at Falkirk allowed them to bring up large siege engines, after which the castle was soon reduced.[9] Dirleton was garrisoned by the English, but must have been retaken by the Scots before 1306, when the English commander Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke recaptured Dirleton once more. It was finally retaken by the Scots some time before 1314, and was slighted, or deliberately damaged, to prevent its reuse by the English.[9]\nThe main gate, built in by the Haliburtons\nHaliburton\nThe castle and lands of Dirleton passed to the Berwickshire family of Haliburton (or Halyburton) when John Haliburton (d.1355) married the heiress of the de Vaux family, shortly before 1350. The castle had been repaired by 1363, when it was seized by William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas,[8] during his brief rebellion against King David II,[5] although it was later returned to the Haliburtons. In the 1420s, Sir Walter Haliburton (d. before 1447) acted as a hostage in exchange for the release of King James I, who had been held captive by the English since 1406.[8] He was rewarded in 1439 by being appointed Treasurer of Scotland.[10] Either Walter, or his eldest son John (d. before 1454), was ennobled as a Lord of Parliament in the 1440s, with the title Lord Dirletoun. The Haliburtons carried out extensive works at Dirleton, heightening the original towers, and constructing a new gatehouse to the south-east. A large hall and tower house were added to the castle in the 15th century, forming the east range.[8]\nKing James IV visited Dirleton in September 1505, and gave money to the masons then engaged on works in the north-east part of the castle.[5][8] Later that year, Patrick, the last Haliburton of Dirleton, died, and his estates were divided among his three daughters, Janet, Margaret, and Mariotta.[11] James IV made Patrick Haliburton's widow Christiane Wawane and her brother William Wawane keepers of Dirleton in August 1507.[12]\nRuthven\nThe Murder of David Rizzio, by Sir William Allan, depicting Lord Ruthven and others killing the Queen's secretary in her presence\nThe eldest daughter, Janet, married William Ruthven, 2nd Lord Ruthven (d. 1552) in 1515, and the castle and lordship of Dirleton passed to the Ruthven family. The son of William and Janet, Patrick, 3rd Lord Ruthven (c. 1520–1566), was one of the leaders of the group who murdered David Riccio, private secretary to Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566.[11] Patrick was forced to flee to England, where he died, leaving Dirleton to his son William (c. 1541–1584), who was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581. Lord Gowrie led a plot, later known as the Raid of Ruthven, in which the 16-year-old King James VI was seized, in August 1582. Ruthven then ruled in the king's name, while James was held captive. Although Gowrie was pardoned the following year, he was executed in 1584 for his part in another plot to seize Stirling Castle, and his lands were forfeited to the crown.[8] A keen amateur arboriculturalist, Lord Gowrie is thought to have laid out the gardens at Dirleton, and planted numerous trees.[5]\nAfter the attempted coup failed in May 1584, Dorothea Stewart, Countess of Gowrie, was commanded to surrender Dirleton, Ruthven, Cousland, and the Gowrie lodging in Perth to the crown.[13] James VI granted Dirleton to the Earl of Arran, who entertained the King there for twelve days in May 1585, while there was plague in Edinburgh.[14] The entertainment included a sumptuous banquet and a Robin Hood play.[15] The following year, the castle was restored to Dorothea Stewart, widow of the first Earl,[11] and by 1600 had passed to John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie (c. 1577–1600), their second son. Dorothea Stewart and her new husband Andrew Kerr of Faldonsyde complained in 1597 about a group of local men who stole rabbits from the links of Dirleton and terrorised her tenants. She was still living in the castle in November 1600.[16]\nDirleton played a role in the story of the “Gowrie Conspiracy” of 1600 in that there has long been suspicion that the castle was taken from the Ruthvens and given to Thomas Erskine as a reward for assisting James VI in the murder of Patrick Ruthven's sons: John, 3rd Earl of Gowrie, and his brother Alexander. The official narrative of the Gowrie Conspiracy, provided afterwards by the king, was that he and fifteen retainers, Erskine among them, had arrived at Gowrie House one night in August 1600 because he had been invited there by Alexander. However, as the narrative goes, the two brothers attempted to assassinate James, and in the melee that followed, the two Ruthvens were killed. While this was happening at Gowrie House, the other two Ruthven brothers, William and Patrick, were at Dirleton, apparently unaware of the plot afoot. Finding much to doubt in the king's account, many have argued that James went to Gowrie House with his retinue for the express purpose of murdering John and Alexander, partly because the king owed the Earl of Gowrie a large sum of money and partly because there had long been a rumor that Gowrie was the grandson of James IV, which, if true, would have put him in line for the throne ahead of James VI. After the killings, the king divided the Gowrie estates and bestowed them on the men who had been with him that night. Erskine received the gift of Dirleton Castle in November 1600, which some perceive to be a form of \"blood money\". This perception is further substantiated by the fact that Erskine was created Baron Erskine of Dirletowne in 1604.[17]\nErskine sold the castle to Sir James Douglas in 1625. Douglas sold it on to Alexander Morieson of Prestongrange,[5] who sold it in turn, in 1631, to James Maxwell of Innerwick (d. c. 1650), who was created Earl of Dirletoun in 1646.[8] In October 1641 the Earl of Argyll, Marquess of Hamilton and Earl of Lanark were forced to flee from Edinburgh to Dirleton, the home of Hamilton's mother-in-law, Elizabeth de Boussy, due the conspiracy known as the Incident.[18]\nCromwell\nOliver Cromwell's army invaded Scotland in 1650, during the Third English Civil War, and defeated the Scots Royalists at Dunbar on 3 September. With this victory, Cromwell gained effective control of southern Scotland, but bands of Royalist moss-troopers continued to harry the English supply lines. One such band was based at Dirleton, and Cromwell ordered General Monck and General Lambert, with 1,600 troops, to capture the castle. This was achieved on 10 November, using mortars to destroy the drawbridge and inner gate.[19] The captain of the moss-troopers was hanged from the walls with two of his comrades.[20] The castle was slighted once more, and although briefly used as a field hospital, it was then left to decay.[21] The soldier and engineer responsible for Cromwell's effective use of artillery was a German, Major Joachim Hane. He also designed fortresses near Inverness and in Ayr, and directed the mortar fire at the siege of Stirling Castle in August 1651. He later spent a year spying for Cromwell's Secretary of State, John Thurloe.[22]\nThe west flower garden\nNisbet\nDirleton Castle and estate were purchased, from the widowed Countess of Dirletoun, by the lawyer John Nisbet (c. 1609–1687) in 1663. Nisbet, who took the title Lord Dirleton when he was appointed as a judge, built a new house at Archerfield, to the north-west of the village. The Nisbets continued to maintain the gardens around the castle as part of the park around Archerfield, and installed the bowling green. The 19th-century garden walls were added by Mary Nisbet, Lady Elgin (1778–1855), wife of the Earl of Elgin, as part of a \"beautification\" of Dirleton village.[23] In the mid-19th century, two new parterres were laid out by the head gardener, David Thompson. Although neither survived, the west garden was restored, based on 19th-century plans, in 1993. The north garden was replaced in the 1920s with an Arts and Crafts-style garden of herbaceous borders.[24] Also in the 1920s, the castle was passed into state care, and is now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland, an agency of the Scottish Government.[5]\nThe castle and grounds are protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument,[25] while the gardens appear on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national register of historic gardens.[5] The castle, doocot, and boundary walls are Category A listed buildings, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland.[23]\nWitches of Dirleton Castle\nBetween 1649-50 almost 600 people in south and east Scotland (mainly women) were accused of witchcraft. Six were from Dirleton.[26]\nAgnes Clarkson\nIn June 1649, Agnes Clarkson, who was a widow, confessed to witchcraft after an interrogation (thought to be by the church court, or presbytery, led by John Makghie, the church minister of Dirleton Kirk). She said that had been visited by a woman from Longniddry who had already been burned for witchcraft, and later she had been visited by the devil himself \"in the liknesse of a black dun dogge and went up and doun the hous, and seised upon the said Agnes her cloths, and therafter, turning into the liknesse of a black man, had carnall copulation with her.”.[26] She became the devil's servant, and attended “a meeting of the devil and sundrie others with him upon the green of Diriltoun”. She named the other people who were there and had danced with the devil. She accused Patrick Watson of nearby West Fenton, his wife Manie Halieburton, and Bessie Hogge. Her evidence led to the witches trial. It was likely she was held in Dirleton castle's pit prison.[26]\nManie Halieburton and Patrick Watson\nManie Halieburton was accused of witchcraft by her husband Patrick Watson and by Agnes Clarkson. She confessed to having been tricked by the devil eighteen years previously. When their daughter was sick, the devil appeared as a man who claimed to be a physician. They had fed him and paid him she had \"had carnall copulatioun\" with him, when Patrick was out. So she became the devil's servant.[26]\nThe trial included being assessed by the 'witch pricker' John Kincaid, who searched for a part of the accused body which was not subject to pain, or other 'devil's mark' bodily signs to be used as evidence that they were indeed witches. Kincaid said \"I fand the divellis marke upon the baksyde of the said Patrik Watson a little under the point of his left shoulder, and upon the left syde of the said Meinie Halliburton hir neck a little abone hir left shoulder, whairof they wer not sensible, nether came furth thairof any bloode.”[26]\nBessie Hogge, Marione Meik and Margaret Goodfellow\nThe evidence against these three women, has not survived, but they were accused of dancing with the devil or otherwise participating in a relationship with him.\nDirleton Castle, Great Hall (detail)\nThe trials took place in the Dirleton Castle Great Hall, and although the sentence and action taken do not survive either, those accused were usually executed, as required by law,[27] often by strangling. [26] Official apology\nNicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, issued an officially apology for the first time, for the persecution of alleged witches during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.[28]\nDescription\nFloor plans of the castle.

Y Lord's chamber, base of tower house.\nThe castle is built on a natural rocky outcrop, on a low ridge overlooking the farmland of East Lothian. It comprises a kite-shaped courtyard, 40 metres (130 ft) by 27 metres (89 ft), flanked by buildings on the south and east sides. The most substantial remains are the Ruthven Lodging, the gatehouse, and the de Vaux keep to the south, while only the basement of the east range survives. Fragments of the north and west curtain walls outline the courtyard, which was formerly divided in two by further 16th-century buildings. The castle was originally approached from the south, via a bridge and 3.4-metre (11 ft) drawbridge, across a 15-metre (49 ft) wide ditch. In the 16th century, steps were built to access the Ruthven lodging from the west.[4]\nThe keep\nThe keep, or donjon, survives largely intact from the 13th century, and forms the south-west part of the present castle. Described by architectural historian W. D. Simpson as a \"cluster keep\",[29] it comprises a large round tower to the south, a smaller round tower to the west, with the two joined by a square tower. The masonry is of squared ashlar, or dressed stone blocks. Internally, the original use of the rooms is difficult to interpret,[4] although the round towers may have served as private suites for Lord Dirleton and his Lady.[30] The large tower contains a six-sided chamber at ground level, possibly a kitchen, with a seven-sided main chamber above. This room has a pointed vaulted ceiling, window seats in the large windows around the south wall, and a carved fireplace at the north. To the east is a postern, or side door, and beyond is a well. Adjacent to the well is a floor hatch, which would have allowed food to be transferred directly from the kitchen to a servery above.[31] A room in the square tower to the west, possibly the lord's bedroom,[8] has holes in the ceiling to allow smoke from braziers to escape. The more ruined west round tower probably contained another hall, with chambers above and storage below.[30] In the 17th century, the top of the main round tower was lowered and remodelled to form a gun platform.[32]\nOnly fragments of the rest of the 13th-century castle remain. A fourth tower, where the Ruthven lodging now stands, may have completed the \"cluster keep\".[8] Bases of round towers at the south-east and north-east corners of the castle are visible below the later walls. Parts of the north-west wall are 13th-century work, as is the blocked postern in the basement of the east range.[8] The overall plan of the castle, however, was not greatly changed through later rebuilding work. Dirleton is the earliest dated example in Scotland of a castle with round towers that project beyond the curtain wall, as opposed to those at Dunstaffnage, for example, where the towers are contained within the walls.[7] This new form was subsequently used in other 13th-century Scottish castles, including Bothwell and Kildrummy.[7]\nVaulted basement of the east range\nThe east range and gatehouse\nThe gatehouse, kitchens, and east range were built by the Haliburtons in the 14th and 15th centuries. The gatehouse, built in the 14th century to the east of the keep, is similar to the one at nearby Tantallon Castle.[8] It is fronted by a high, pointed arch, formerly with bartizans, small round turrets, at the top. The gate was protected by a drawbridge over the outer ditch, a portcullis, and three sets of doors. Guard rooms open off the entrance passage, and a round opening in the roof, known as a \"murder hole\", allowed defenders to drop objects on to any attacker who breached the outer gate.[33]\nThe large kitchens occupy the south-east angle of the castle. The 9-metre (30 ft) high main kitchen has two 4-metre (13 ft) wide fireplaces for cooking, and a circular vent in the vaulted ceiling.[4] Hatches in the floor give access to a well (11.5 metres (38 ft) deep) and cellars below. The adjacent passage linked the kitchen to the hall in the east range.\nRemains of the hall and the basement of the tower house\nThe east range itself runs the length of the east side of the castle, and originally comprised a large hall, with a square tower house at the north-east corner. Although only the basement survives, this once formed one of the finest noble residences of its time in Scotland, and would have been similar to the contemporary buildings at Doune Castle.[34] The basement is a single tunnel vault, with low walls subdividing the area into stores. Two large ovens and a well lie at the south end, while at the east is the 13th-century postern, blocked when the wall was thickened to support the new buildings above, and re-used as a fireplace.[35] At the north end of the basement is a vaulted prison for freemen, and below this, a rock-cut pit, 3 metres (9.8 ft) square, to house prisoners of the peasant classes.[35] Above the prison, but still within the basement, is a vaulted chapel with various ceremonial recesses, such as a sacristy and a piscina, or water basin.[35] A private chamber for the priest is next door. The hall above is 22 metres (72 ft) by 7.5 metres (25 ft),[29] and once had a high timber roof, and a minstrel's gallery at the south end. An ornately carved stone buffet, or cupboard, is located on this wall, which formed part of the servery next to the kitchen.[35] At the north-east corner of the castle, a tower house provided accommodation for the Lord's family and guests. Again, only the lowest floor remains, above the chapel. This probably formed a private chamber for the Lord, and was connected to the adjacent hall.[35]\nThe north façade of the Ruthven Lodging\nThe Ruthven Lodging\nConstructed by the Ruthvens after they acquired the castle around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging represents the final stage of building at Dirleton. In the later part of the 16th century, it served as the main residence of Lady Dorothea, wife of the first Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 children.[36] The three-storey building is constructed, like the Haliburton range, from undressed stone, although the Ruthven Lodging is decorated with string courses, horizontal mouldings running around the walls. The large windows were protected by iron grilles and small gun holes.[36] The rectangular Lodging is immediately to the north of the de Vaux building, separated by a narrow irregular courtyard, which is accessed via a passage in the ground floor of the Lodging. The remainder of the ground floor was occupied by cellars, with family rooms and bedrooms on the upper floors. The first-floor dining room was paved with patterned floor tiles, and may once have had a painted timber ceiling.[36]\nThe gardens\nThe 16th-century doocot\nThe castle is set within extensive gardens, bounded by a 19th-century wall. The gardens were first laid out in the 16th century, but have undergone many changes. A bowling green lies to the west of the castle, fringed by yew trees, which may once have formed a hedge around a parterre in this area.[37] West of the bowling green is a flower garden, laid out in 1993 to an 18th-century design, and containing yew, cedar, monkey puzzle and Lawson's cypress trees. To the north is the 1920s Arts and Crafts garden, which is home to a 215-metre (705 ft) -long herbaceous border, and is overlooked by a castellated 19th-century gazebo, or summer house. The border is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as being the longest in the world. The rest of the gardens comprise lawns, with numerous mature specimen trees, including redwood, beech, and sycamore.[5]\nThere is a well-preserved 16th-century beehive-shaped doocot, or pigeon house, in the castle grounds. The doocot is 7.6 metres (25 ft) high, and contains around 1000 nesting boxes for pigeons, which were an important source of food for the castle's inhabitants. To the north-east, now located outside the castle gardens, is a 16th-century gateway which formerly served the castle, but now serves the adjacent farm.\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\nLindsay, Maurice.

    "text": "Fortress overlooking the harbour of Dunbar, Scotland\nDunbar Castle was one of the strongest fortresses in Scotland, situated in a prominent position overlooking the harbour of the town of Dunbar, in East Lothian. Several fortifications were built successively on the site, near the English-Scottish border. The last was slighted in 1567; it is a ruin today.\nStructure\nThe body of buildings measured in excess of 165 feet (50 m) from east to west, and in some places up to 210 feet (64 m) from north to south. The South Battery, which Grose supposes to have been the citadel or keep, is situated on a detached perpendicular rock, only accessible on one side, 72 feet (22 m) high, and is connected to the main part of the castle by a passage of masonry measuring 69 feet (21 m). The interior of the citadel measures 54 by 60 feet (16 m × 18 m) within the walls. Its shape is octagonal. Five of the gun-ports remain, which are called the 'arrow-holes'. They measure 4 feet (1.2 m) at the mouth and only 16 inches (41 cm) at the other end. The buildings are arched and extend 8 feet (2.4 m) from the outer walls, and look into an open court, whence they derive their light.[1]\n19th-century engraving of the castle\nAbout the middle of the fortress, part of a wall remains, through which there is a gateway, surmounted with armorial bearings. This gate seems to have led to the principal apartments. In the centre, are the arms of George, 10th Earl of Dunbar, who succeeded his uncle in 1369, and who besides the earldom of Dunbar and March, inherited the Lordship of Annandale and the Isle of Man from his heroic aunt, Black Agnes of Dunbar. They must have been placed there after his succession, as he was the first who assumed those sculptured Arms: viz, a large triangular shield, and thereon a lion rampant, within a bordure charged with eight roses. The shield is adorned with a helmet, carrying a crest: a horse's head bridled. On the right are the Arms of the Bruces, and on the left those of the Isle of Man.[1]\nThe castle towers had communication with the sea, and dip low in many places. North-east from the front of the castle is a large natural cavern, chiefly of black stone, which looks like the mouth of the Acheron – a place that leads to melancholy streams. This spot is supposed to have formed part of the dungeon where prisoners were confined, such as Gavin Douglas, Bishop of Dunkeld, who was a prisoner here in 1515. There is, however, also a dark postern which gives access to a rocky inlet from the sea, and it seems probable that it was through this that Sir Alexander Ramsay and his followers entered with a supply of provisions to the besieged in 1338.[1]\nIt was long said the castle was invulnerable, possibly because of the many sieges it sustained. The castle was built with a red stone similar to that found in the quarries near Garvald. Large masses of walls, which have fallen beneath the weight of time, appear to be vitrified or run together. In the north-west part of the ruins is an apartment about 12 feet (3.7 m) square, and nearly inaccessible, which tradition states was the apartment of Mary, Queen of Scots.[1]\nHistory\nEarly history\nThe Votadini or Gododdin are thought to have been the first to defend this site as its original Brythonic name, dyn barr, means 'the fort of the point'. By the 7th century, Dunbar Castle was a central defensive position of the Kings of Bernicia, an Anglian kingdom that took over from the British Kingdom of Bryneich.\nNorthumbria\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, Dunbar Castle was held by an Ealdorman owing homage to either the Kings at Bamburgh Castle, or latterly the Kings of York. In 678 Saint Wilfrid was imprisoned at Dunbar, following his expulsion from his see of York by Ecgfrith of Northumbria.\nLater, Dunbar was said to have been burnt by Kenneth MacAlpin, King of the Scots. Certainly he is on record in possession of the castle.[2]\nKingdom of the Scots\nIn the 10th and early 11th centuries, the Norsemen made increasing inroads in Scotland and in 1005 a record exists of a Patrick de Dunbar, under Malcolm II, engaged against the Norse invaders in the north at Murthlake a town of Marr where alongside Kenneth, Thane of the Isles, and Grim, Thane of Strathearn, he was slain.[2]\nThe first stone castle is thought to have been built by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria, after his exile from England, following the Harrowing of the North, by William the Conqueror after Gospatric took refuge at the court of Malcolm III of Scotland. Gospatric was a powerful landowner in both kingdoms and could summon many men, which encouraged Malcolm to give him more lands in East Lothian, the Merse and Lauderdale, as recompense for those lost further south and in return for loyalty as is usual under the feudal system. Sir Walter Scott argued that Cospatric or Gospatrick was a contraction of Comes Patricius. In any case, King Malcolm III is recorded as bestowing the manor of Dunbar &c., on \"the expatriated Earl of Northumberland\".[2]\nIn June 1338, Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie relieved Dunbar Castle and assisted the Countess of Dunbar (\"Black Agnes of Dunbar\"). Together they successfully defended the castle against the siege by William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury of England.\nJames IV\nThe castle remained the stronghold of the Earls of Dunbar until the forfeiture of George, Earl of March, in 1457, when the Castle was dismantled to prevent its occupation by the English. It was restored by James IV later in the century. Andrew Wood of Largo was the keeper.[3] In April 1497 timber was bought for the \"Hannis tower\" and the master mason Walter Merlioun was completing the gatehouse or \"fore work\". Nails were bought for the \"yetts\" of the gatehouse, a wooden portcullis and a metal grille or yett made by Thomas Barker. John the Quarrier excavated a new well.[4] James IV visited in April 1497 and gave the masons drinksilver reward payments in May.[5]\nBuilding lime was brought from Cousland.[6] The hinges or \"crukis\" for the iron yett were made in the forge at Edinburgh Castle.[7] A carpenter, Patrick Falconer, measured the roof or ceiling of the king's chamber at Edinburgh castle to make a similar roof at Dunbar.[8] In August 1497 two Dunbar carpenters, William Young and Thomas Makachane, started to roof the Hannis tower. In September it was finished by Andrew the \"Sclater\". Slates and rafters were brought to Dunbar in Will Merrymowth's boat.[9] In 1501 new iron window grills or yetts were provided.[10]\nAndrew Forman, Bishop of Moray, was made keeper of Dunbar Castle in September 1503.[11] Ferquhard Mackintosh, an heir to the Lordship of the Isles, was held prisoner in the castle for over ten years.[12]\nJames Stewart, Duke of Albany\nThe castle came under the control of the Duke of Albany during the minority of James V. The garrison of 100 French soldiers was paid by Francis I of France, who sent their wages to the quartermaster Maurice de Nogent.[13] During this period the artillery bulwark to the west was built.[14] It may have been designed by Antoine d'Arces, Sieur de la Bastie who was placed in charge of the castle in December 1514.[15] Albany organised further repairs and amendments in June 1527.[16]\nAn Italian drawing for a fortification of this period by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, marked as an opinion for \"il Duca D'Albania,\" has been associated with Dunbar.[17] An article by the historian Bryony Coombs further explores the activities of the Duke of Albany and his architectural and artistic connections that informed the design of the blockhouse and situates the building in a European context, and highlights the resemblance of the drawing to the Fort de Salses as built for Ferdinand II of Aragon.[18]\nJames V\nJames V came to the castle frequently in the summer of 1537 after the death of his first wife, Madeleine of Valois, and oversaw the arrangement of his artillery. A Scottish courtier James Atkinhead was installed as Captain.[19] In 1540, Aitkenhead's garrison included a number of foreign artillery and handgun experts, including Master Wolf, Morso or Marco of Armorica who was the armourer, Peter Cumbo, Tibo Rukour, John Rubino, Peter Schoffett.[20] Patrick Wemyss of Pittencrieff was captain of the castle in 1542 and spent £100 Scots on repairs.[21]\nRough Wooing\nIn July 1545 the Earl of Angus mentioned that Edinburgh Castle had been re-fortified, \"but as for Dunbar he heard of nothing done to it\".[22] French money amounting to £1,370 in 1546 was sent to fund repairs to the castle in 1546.[23] In August 1547 the cannon called \"Thrawynmouth\" was shipped from Dunbar for use at the siege of St Andrews Castle.[24] Repair works were carried out by Robert Hamilton of Briggis.[25]\nThe castle was burnt by the Earl of Shrewsbury on a punitive raid during the Rough wooing in 1548.[26] A French soldier, Monsieur La Chapelle was made keeper of the castle on 18 June 1548 and William Hamilton of Humby was captain.[27] Further re-fortifications in 1548 were directed by Piero Strozzi and Migliorino Ubaldini.[28][29] Regent Arran ordered a mason John Arthur to come from Haddington to work on the castle.[30]\nThe English soldier Thomas Holcroft described the activities of Peter Landstedt, a lieutenant of the German mercenary Courtpennick (Konrad Pennick), on 24 September 1549. Despite cannon fire from the castle, Landstedt got a foothold in a house in Dunbar, and used the furniture to start fires in the town. Landstedt planned to make an entrenchment in front of the castle to place his guns, and he thought the walls of the castle near the town were \"very old and low,\" and now \"revised with earth and mounds\", these old walls being stone on the natural rock. He thought the old high walls of the inner court could be broken by bombardment to destroy the \"first walls\" of the castle. These plans were not realised.[31] Regent Arran gave a tip to \"devisaris and draweris of the fort\", setting out a new fortification in December 1550.[32] The French soldier and writer, Jean de Beaugué, described the castle and its proximity to key sites in the war:The castle is a very handsome and strong place built on a lofty rock on the edge of the sea, very difficult of approach, and on which so much art has been displayed, that few places are to be found anywhere at the present time, which are by nature more commodious, less exposed to battery, and all other methods of storming, than this castle, which besides, is sufficiently near Lauder, Dunglass, Haddington, Eyemouth, Fast Castle, and the sea road of North Berwick and the Bass.[33]\nReformation crisis\nDuring her Regency, Mary of Guise employed an Italian military engineer called Lorenzo Pomarelli.[34] The French ambassador in London, Antoine de Noailles advised her to strengthen and repair her fortresses including Dunbar.[35] Mary of Guise came to Dunbar Castle in June 1559 in fear of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation who occupied Edinburgh.[36] Guise sent money to French captain of Dunbar, Corbeyran de Sarlabous, for two week's wages for workmen in April 1560.[37] In May, an Italian engineer was working on further improvements for the French garrison.[38] These works were inspected by Robert Hamilton in Briggs, keeper of Linlithgow Palace and Master of the Royal Artillery, and Robert Montgomery in July 1560, after the death of Mary of Guise, on behalf of the Lords of the Congregation who reported that the Castle was \"more ample by the double than it was of before\" and capable of holding 500 more soldiers. The new work was immediately demolished as a provision of the Treaty of Edinburgh. 100 English workmen called \"pioneers\" were sent to the castle in August.[39] Local landowners were tasked with the demolition of part of a \"rampire,\" a rampart with its ditch and counter scarp, and a great platform for artillery.[40] However, the French captain, Corbeyran de Sarlabous, remained in charge of the castle and refurbished a cavern which was within the area scheduled for demolition.[41] The rebel Lord Sempill found a refuge in the castle in August 1560. The Castle remained garrisoned by 60 French troops under the command of Sarlabous until September 1561.[42]\nMary, Queen of Scots\nMary, Queen of Scots made Robert Anstruther captain of Dunbar in July 1561. He took charge of the cannons and ammunition according to an inventory made by Robert Hamilton of Briggs.[43] Soon after her return to Scotland in August 1561, she appointed her half-brother Lord John keeper of the castle. In November 1561 John Chisholm, comptroller clerk of the royal artillery provided six culverins. The master of work William MacDowall and David Rowan, an expert gunner from Edinburgh castle surveyed the fort.[44] Mary stayed at Dunbar with Lord John on 30 December 1562.[45] Chisholm shipped cannon and gun carriages from Dunbar north to Aberdeen and back in October 1562 during operations against the Earl of Huntly.[46]\nMary appointed Simon Preston of Craigmillar captain of Dunbar. She visited in February 1564 and came to stay at the castle for a week in November 1564.[47] In August 1565, during the rebellion against Mary, Queen of Scots called the Chaseabout Raid, she ordered repairs to the gun emplacements and artillery, and hand tools that might be needed to re-build the ramparts during a siege.[48] She was brought to the castle by the Earl of Bothwell and then confronted her enemies at the battle of Carberry Hill on 15 June 1567.\nThere was a siege in September 1567 to eject Bothwell's supporters and the captain, Patrick Whitelaw or Quhytelaugh. The bakers and butchers of Haddington were summoned to supply the camp, and brewers were ordered to bring ale.[49] John Chisholm brought guns from Edinburgh Castle.[50] William Kirkcaldy of Grange was made keeper of the castle on 1 October.[51]\nSlighting and demolition\nDunbar Castle was finally slighted by order of the Parliament of Scotland in December 1567. Dunbar and the fortress on Inchkeith were to be \"cast down utterly to the ground and destroyed in such a way that no foundation thereof be the occasion to build thereupon in time coming.\"[52] The Historie of King James the Sext notes the order to demolish the \"king's hous of strenthe.\"[53] William Drury reported that Regent Moray was prevented from finishing the demolition in January 1568, as the master carpenter (probably Andrew Mansioun) estimated the work would cost £2000 Scots. It was said that the same sum spent on rebuilding would make it \"one of the strongest places in Scotland\".[54] In September 1568, some of the stone was selected for reuse at the quayside of the Shore of Leith.[55]\nSee also\nList of places in East Lothian\nReferences\nExternal links\nHistoric Environment Scotland. \"Dunbar Castle (57687)\".

    "text": "Building in East Lothian in Scotland\nFa'side Castle (Faside Estate) has previously been known as Fawside, Falside, Ffauside, Fauxside, or Fawsyde and is a 15th-century keep located in East Lothian in Scotland. The castle is approximately 2 miles (3 kilometres) southwest of Tranent, and 2 mi (3 km) southeast of Musselburgh. The building was restored in the 1980s and is now protected as a category B listed building.[1]\nHistory\nThe name dates from 1189, when the monks of Newbattle Abbey granted land to Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester to build the castle on the site. It was in the possession of Alan la Zouche, 1st Baron la Zouche of Ashby, the son in law of Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester, on behalf of his wife, when it was besieged by Sir William Douglas in 1288. The land was lost to Robert the Bruce after the De Quincy family declared their loyalty to Edward I of England. Bruce granted the lands to the Seton family.\nThe Fawsydes of that Ilk acquired land in the area from the Setons in 1371.[2] The earliest part of the present building was constructed by the Fawsydes in the 15th century.[1]\nThe castle was burned by the English before the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, which was fought nearby on 10 September 1547, suffocating or burning all those inside. Mary, Queen of Scots left Fa'side on the morning of 15 June 1567 for the Battle of Carberry Hill. She changed into a short skirt and left her fine clothes behind in a chest.[3]\nThe castle was rebuilt and extended to the south in the late 16th century.[1] A surviving oak bed, now at Biggar Museum, was made for Margaret Fawside, who married Patrick Levingstone of Saltcoats near Gullane.[4]\nOn 5 November 1620 a number of local and neighbouring landowners had dinner with Janet Lawson, Lady Fawside, at the castle and illegally combined together to set and raised the price of coals from their coalmines. The Privy Council of Scotland found their actions unlawful and the lairds were ordered to pay a fine of £2,000 and be imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. In defence the landowners claimed their coal was unprofitable, that the workings of Little Fawside (belonging to the Master of Elphinstone) were on fire, and the Fawside coal mine had bankrupted the old laird.[5]\nThe Fawsydes sold the castle in 1631 to an Edinburgh burgess and merchant called Hamilton. By the 19th century it had fallen into ruin, and was close to being demolished altogether in the 1970s. However, the castle was bought and restored by Thomas Moodie Craig. Author and historian Nigel Tranter set up the Fa'side Restoration Society in 1970 through the St. Andrews Society of East Lothian, and introduced Craig to the castle in 1975. After investigation it was discovered that the original name of the castle was Fawside Castle. The restoration work began in 1976 was completed by 1982. The castle remains in private ownership. Faside Estate includes a stud farm and a bed & breakfast business. The building has five bedrooms while the tourist accommodation is in a tower and two cottages.[6]\nDescription\nFa'side is a 7,411 square feet (688.5 m2) L-plan building, being a fifteenth-century four-storey keep with a later turreted block added. There is a vaulted basement. The castle stands on a high ridge with extensive views over East Lothian and the Firth of Forth.\nAdditional Photos\nSee also\nRestoration of castles in Scotland\nReferences\nBibliography\nCoventry, Martin (2001) The Castles of Scotland.

    "text": "Luffness House in 2019.\nLuffness Castle, also known as Luffness House, is a house built in a former fortification near the village of Aberlady, East Lothian, Scotland.\nHistory\nThe lands around the current house were a part of the estates of the Gospatrick Earls of Lothian, but in the 12th Century they were given to the Lindsay family in marriage and this family constructed a castle on the site in the 13th century, this was described as a large and strong fortress. Some of the property was donated to the Church as a memorial to Sir David Lindsay, High Chamberlain of Scotland in 1256 and a Regent for Alexander III, who died on crusade which was under the leadership of Louis of France. On his deathbed Sir David promised to donate land for a religious house so long as his remains were returned to Scotland. A Carmelite friary was then built nearby in 1293 and remnants of the priory still exist overgrown within the woods. Edward I and an English army occupied the castle in 1311. It was sacked in 1547 by an English force under the command of Edward Clinton, Lord Clinton.\nThe English army treasurer and diplomat Ralph Sadler advised the Earl of Shrewsbury that a new fort at Aberlady would support an English garrison to be installed nearby inland at Haddington. There were also suggestions that an English fort should be built for this purpose at \"White-castell\" at Nunraw or on the \"Pethes\", a narrow route between hills in Scotland.[1]\nFrench and Scots soldiers, directed by Paul de Thermes, built a fort here in 1549 to interrupt the English supply to their garrison at Haddington.[2] On 23 June 1549 Regent Arran summoned neighbouring villagers to fight off English soldiers trying to prevent the buildings work. On 25 June Arran requested the lairds of East and West Lothian to provide labourers. The royal treasurer's accounts refer to the \"fort of Aberlady\". Oxen dragged guns from the fort to the nearest harbour in January 1550 for shipping to Monifieth, to be used against Broughty Castle.[3] This fort was demolished on the orders of Marie de Guise in 1552.\nIn the second half of the 16th Century the ownership of Luffness was transferred to the Hepburn Earls of Bothwell who rebuilt the castle and in the 17th century the estate change ownership again to the Durham family while an Adam Duff of Luffness is recorded in 1704. In 1739 the Hope Earl of Hopetoun bought Luffness and in 1822 the castle and was altered and extended by William Burn with the further works carried out under the direction of David Bryce in 1846 and 1874. Today the house is well maintained, and is still occupied by the Hope family.[4]\nFriary remains, Luffness (geograph 2218928)\nDescription\nLuffness House is presently a tower house of three storeys with an attic and it forms a T shape with the square turret forming its stem. There is a turnpike stair which occupies the first two floors. Nigel Tranter thought that this stair incorporated what was left of the castle, and is likely from the 13th century.[5] The house is situated at the northwestern angle of a square fortification which is delineated by a partially infilled ditch which may be a remnant of the French built fortifications from 1549, or it may be the remains of the earlier castle.[6]\nSee also\nList of places in East Lothian\nReferences\nBibliography\nLindsay, Maurice The Castles of Scotland, Constable & Co. 1986\nCoventry, Martin The Castles of Scotland, Goblinshead 1995\nExternal links\nLuffness Castle website\n56°00′51″N 2°50′38″W / 56.0141°N 2.8440°W / 56.0141; -2.8440\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in East Lothian, Scotland, UK\nSaltoun Hall\nSaltoun Hall North Lodge\nSaltoun Hall is an historic house standing in extensive lands off the B6355, Pencaitland to East Saltoun road, about 1.5 miles from each village, in East Lothian, Scotland. The house is reached by way of an impressive gateway and is situated at grid reference NT461685.\nHistory\nSaltoun Hall began life, in the 12th century, as a tower or castle[1] and, at that time, was in the hands of the powerful de Morville family. Hugh de Morville was granted lands in the 12th century by King David I at Saltoun and his family were created hereditary High Constables of Scotland.[2] Hugh de Morville was famed for his patronage of religious establishments: he founded Dryburgh Abbey in the old county of Roxburghshire around 1150.[3]\nBy 1260, Sir William Abernethy owned the lands and castle at Saltoun, and his descendant Sir Lawrence Abernethy was created Lord Saltoun in 1445. The Abernethys were owners at Saltoun for nearly 400 years but in 1643, the estates were bought by Andrew Fletcher, Lord Innerpeffer, to whose family the land still belongs.[2] His grandson Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun (1655–1716) is remembered for his opposition to the Acts of Union 1707.[4]\nSaltoun Hall Doocot\nOver the years, Saltoun Castle was spared trouble and there is only one recorded incident at the castle. In 1548, during Somerset's occupation of Haddington, John Cockburn of Ormiston held the castle for the English commander Grey of Wilton. Cockburn was an 'assured' Scot, one who agreed with the English point of view during the \"Rough Wooing\" campaign. The castle was quickly retaken in February 1548 by the Earl of Arran, who brought artillery from Edinburgh castle, and hanged 5 of Cockburn's men and took 5 prisoner.[5]\nThere were many extensions, changes and renewals at the castle but there are no records until the days of the Fletcher family. In 1769, Lord Fletcher added a new wing on the south side of the building. A separate extension was built for the library in 1779. This created an L-shaped house and a 'great stair' was built in the angle. In 1803, architect Robert Burn designed new turrets on the corners giving the 'new' house a castellated appearance. His son, William Burn, completely transformed the building on a large scale in 1817, creating what was described as a 'bleak magnificence'. A large square turret was added. The interior is in the Gothic Revival style, with rib vaulting throughout. A new corridor was built to provide a Gothic gallery and rooms were recast in a Grecian style. The house was sold in the late 1960s and subdivided into apartments.[6] The Fletchers sold the building and some of the estate but the family still live nearby. Today's house owes much to the architectural style of William Burn. The house is said to be haunted by a 'grey lady'.[1]\nSaltoun Hall was famed for a formally designed garden in the 19th century.[7] Botanist David McHattie Forbes served as Foreman Forester for the estate from 1883 until his departure for Hawaii in 1887.\nListed buildings\nThe house is a category A listed building[8] and the doocot is listed at category B.[9]\nReferences\nExternal links\nSaltoun Hall Official Page\n55°54′21″N 2°51′49″W / 55.9059°N 2.8637°W / 55.9059; -2.8637\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle ruins in East Lothian, Scotland\nYester Castle is a ruined castle, located 1+1⁄2 miles (2.5 kilometres) southeast of the village of Gifford in East Lothian, Scotland. The only remaining complete structure is the subterranean Goblin Ha' or Hobgoblin Ha' (Goblin Hall).[1] It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, recorded as such by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.[2]\nYester castle is on private land and is not open to the public.\nHistory\nThe tower in 1814\nOriginally known as Yestred (from the Brythonic Ystrad, meaning strath or dale), the barony of Yester was granted by King William the Lion to Hugo de Giffard, a Norman immigrant given land in East Lothian during the reign of King David I. Latin language documents note the location as Zester in vital records.[3]\nThe original stone keep, built before 1267, is generally considered to be by Sir Hugo de Giffard. A grandson of the first Laird of Yester, he served as a guardian of the young Alexander III of Scotland, and was by repute a magician and necromancer. Alexander III is known to have been at Yester on and around 24 May 1278, where he corresponded with Edward I of England. Following the Scots Wars of Independence, Yester was rebuilt as a castle of enceinte.\nIn 1298, during the Battle of Falkirk, Alexander de Welles, Master of Torphichen Preceptory, was killed. Based on the heraldic evidence there is very little doubt that Alexander de Welles was a member of the Lincolnshire Welle(s) family. Also at Falkirk was Adam de Welle(s) of Lincolnshire and of the Castle of Yester in Lothian, to whom the English King Edward I, during his occupation of Scotland, gave various properties confiscated from the Lothian nobility and gentry.[4]\nIn 1357, there being no male line left of the Giffards, Joanna, a daughter and co-heiress, of the last Sir Hugo de Giffard, married Sir William [or Thomas] de la Haye of Peebles, of Locherworth (Locherwart), the Sheriff of Peebles. He was invested with the barony and lands of Yester through his wife. The barony has stayed with the Hay family ever since.\nJohn Hay of Yester was in 1487 created a Lord of Parliament, as the first Lord Hay of Yester. In 1513 during the disastrous Battle of Flodden, John, second Lord Hay, was killed along with a great proportion of the country's fighting men. In May 1544 during the conflict known as the Rough Wooing, the castle, village, and harvest were burnt by the English army returning from the burning of Edinburgh.[5]\nJohn, 4th Lord Hay defended the castle from an English force in 1547, and was captured later that year at the Battle of Pinkie and held in the Tower of London for three years. In February 1548 the English commander Grey of Wilton captured the castle and put George Douglas of Pittendreich in charge of Yester and Dalkeith. French soldiers taken at Yester were used at hostages by the English.[6] According to Ulpian Fulwell, the captured garrison was mostly Scottish or Spanish. Two men suspected of shouting insults defaming Edward VI were made to fight a duel at the market place of Haddington.[7]\n1557 saw the death of the 4th Lord Hay. His son William abandoned the castle and moved into a new tower house on the site of the present day mansion of Yester House. In 1646 the 8th Lord John Hay was created Marquess of Tweeddale. The castle gradually fell into disrepair, and by the late 17th century was in a very parlous state, the stones having been much quarried for building material. Although the castle almost disappeared completely, Sir Hugo's original Goblin Ha' was tenanted by the Marquess' falconer until 1737. Yester House with its Adam interiors was sold in 1972 to Italian/American operatic composer Gian-Carlo Menotti then left to his son, Chip, who sold it in 2013.\nGoblin Ha' vaulting\nThe Wizard of Yester\nSir Hugo de Giffard was known as the \"Wizard of Yester\", and was considered to be a powerful warlock and necromancer. It is in the undercroft of the castle that he was thought to practise his sorcery. The 15th-century chronicler Walter Bower mentions the large cavern in Yester Castle, thought locally to have been formed by magical artifice:\n\"The death occurred of Hugh Gifford, lord of Yester. Old tales tell that his castle, or at least his cellar and keep, were wrought by witchcraft, for there is there a marvellous underground cavern wonderfully constructed and extending under a large area of ground. It is popularly called Bo' Hall.\"[8]\nLegend supposed that Hugo was able, via a pact with the Devil, to raise a magical army to his aid, and use them to carry out his will. It is this army of hobgoblins that was considered the builders of Yester Castle.\nThe Colstoun Pear\nWhen his daughter Margaret was to marry, Sir Hugo gave her and her husband-to-be, Broun of Colstoun, a hand-picked pear with the proviso that should anything happen to this fruit it would spell disaster for the Broun family. The pear was encased in a silver box and kept safe; the Brouns prospered.\nA few hundred years later however, in 1692, on her wedding night, the fiancée of Sir George Broun, a Baronet of Nova Scotia and inheritor of the Colstoun estate, decided to remove the pear from its casket. The fruit looked as good as when it was picked[citation needed], and she could not resist taking a bite. Misfortune quickly followed. Sir George Broun amassed enormous gambling debts and was forced to sell the estate to his brother Robert. Robert with his two sons were soon after killed, en route to Edinburgh; they were swept away by a flash flood caused by the River Tyne bursting its banks. In destitution, Sir George died in 1718 without a male heir. It was said that after the pear was tasted it turned as hard as rock, and with its bitemark in evidence, it is still at Colstoun House to this day.[9]\nLiterary references\nFor his supposed role in the struggles between King Haakon of Norway and King Alexander, ultimately culminating in the Battle of Largs, Sir Walter Scott immortalises Giffard in Marmion:\nA Clerk could tell what years have flown\nSince Alexander fill’d our throne,\n(Third monarch of that warlike name,)\nAnd eke the time when here he came\nTo seek Sir Hugo, then our lord:\nA braver never drew a sword;\nA wiser never, at the hour\nOf midnight, spoke the word of power:\nThe same, whom ancient records call\nThe founder of the Goblin-Hall.\nMarmion, Canto III, Stanza XIX, lines 324–333.\nSee also\nList of castles in Scotland\nList of places in East Lothian\nReferences\nExternal links\nGenealogical site and Brief history of the Giffards\nA History of the Hays and Yester with impression of the Castle when intact\nGifford Online – village website Archived 5 January 2010 at the Wayback Machine\nColstoun House Website\nHaunted East Lothian: Yester Castle\nthe goblin ha hotel in gifford\n55°53′26.23″N 2°42′37.92″W / 55.8906194°N 2.7105333°W / 55.8906194; -2.7105333\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "name": "Barnbougle Castle",
    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnbougle_Castle",
    "text": "Tower house in Dalmeny, Scotland\nBarnbougle Castle is a historic tower house on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth, between Cramond and Queensferry, and within the parish of Dalmeny. It lies within the Earl of Rosebery's estate, just north-west of Dalmeny House. Although its history goes back to the 13th century, the present castle is the result of rebuilding in 1881 by the 5th Earl of Rosebery, who served as Prime Minister from 1894 to 1895.\nEtymology\nOlder forms of the name include Barnbughall, Barbogle, Parnbogalle, and Pronbugele. This comes from the British brinn bugel, meaning 'shepherd's hill', or bar an bugel, 'shepherd's hill top', or alternatively pren bugel, 'shepherd's tree'.[1][2] All these names likely refer to the high ground which rises immediately behind the shore, which overlooks the grazing around the mouth of the Cockle Burn.[3]\nHistory\nBarnbougle seen from the south-west\nThe first building at Barnbougle was a thirteenth-century tower house, constructed by the Mowbrays, a Norman family who were also lords of Dalmeny and Inverkeithing.[4] Sir John Mowbray of Barnbougle, Laird of Dalmeny, was knighted by Sir Thomas Erskine at the battle of Homildon Hill in 1402.[5]\nThe laird of Barnbougle in 1586, John Mowbray, was a supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots, his wife was a sister of William Kirkcaldy of Grange and two of their daughters served Mary in England. Gillis was betrothed to her apothecary, and Barbara married Gilbert Curll, the queen's secretary.[6] It is thought that Mary gave Gillis Mowbray the jewellery now known as the \"Penicuik Jewels\".[7]\nThe Links of Barnbougle was the scene of a judicial combat on 15 March 1597. James Carmichael had killed Stephen Bruntfield, Captain of Tantallon, in a duel on 22 December 1596. He was made to fight Adam Bruntfield in single combat at Barnbougle.[8] The judges were the Duke of Lennox, the Laird of Buccleuch, and Sir James Sandilands. They wore lightweight clothes of satin and taffeta, one in blue, and one in red. Bruntfield killed Carmichael, according to some accounts in front of 5,000 spectators.[9]\nIn 1615 the Mowbrays sold Barnbougle to Sir Thomas Hamilton, afterwards Earl of Haddington. It was sold again in 1662, by Sir Thomas' grandson, to Sir Archibald Primrose of Carrington, a senior judge who became Lord Justice General of Scotland in 1676. Sir Archibald's eldest son by his second marriage, also Archibald Primrose, was created Earl of Rosebery in 1703, and Barnbougle became the family seat. At some point during the 17th century, the original tower house was rebuilt or replaced.[10]\nIn 1774, a plan for rebuilding the castle was drawn up by the architect Robert Adam. This proposal was for a triangular building, with the original tower at its seaward corner, but it was never executed. By the early 19th century, the castle had become dilapidated, and a wave supposedly washed into the dining room during supper.[4] The 4th Earl of Rosebery had Dalmeny House constructed on the estate, and the family moved in on completion in 1817. Barnbougle was used to store explosives, and after being damaged in an accidental explosion, it was subsequently left as a ruin.[4]\nIn 1881 the castle was entirely reconstructed and extended according to plans by James Maitland Wardrop, of Wardrop & Reid, in the Scots Baronial style. The older fabric of the north side was incorporated into the new building.[10] It was primarily built to house the private library of Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery (1847–1929), who became Prime Minister in 1894.[11] The collection specialised in Napoleonic as Rosebery was the author of Napoleon: The Last Phase.[12] Lord Rosebery practised his speeches here, in a purpose-built gallery hall.[13] Barnbougle remains a part of the Dalmeny Estate, and is still the property of the Rosebery family. It is a category A listed building.[4]\nDescription\nThe castle is built on a projecting rock terrace. It incorporates some of the fabric of the original castle on the north and east sides, but is mainly a late-nineteenth-century construction.[10] There are three storeys and an attic; the building is rubble, dressed in ashlar sandstone. Features include crow-stepped gables, bartizans (small turrets) with water spouts on the two western corners and a crenellated parapet. A panel on the east wall is inscribed \"Remove Not The Ancient Landmark Which Thy Fathers Have Set. Proverbs XXII.28\".[4] A 2.4-metre (7 ft 10 in) high obelisk sundial stands in the castle garden, having been moved there in 1890.[14]\nTraditions\nThe antiquary William Wallace Fyfe recorded, in 1851, a legend associated with Barnbougle and nearby Hound Point. He relates that \"whenever the death of any of its [Barnbougle's] lords is about to occur, the unwonted apparition of a black man, accompanied by a hound, appears upon the point, and winds from his bugle the death note of the baron. Hence the origin of the ancient name of Bar'n-bugle.\"[15] Fyfe took the story as inspiration for a poem relating the adventures of \"Sir Roger Mowbray\" and his faithful dog on Crusade in the Holy Land, culminating in Sir Roger's death and closing with the words:\nAnd ever when Barnbougle's lords\nAre parting this scene below\nCome hound and ghost to this haunted coast\nWith death notes winding slow.\nA number of variations on this legend have been recorded, including versions where the baying of a hound, rather than a trumpet, precedes a death.[16]\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Barnbougle Castle.\nRosebery Venues web site\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Historic castle in Edinburgh, Scotland\nFor other uses, see Edinburgh Castle (disambiguation).\nEdinburgh Castle is a historic castle in Edinburgh, Scotland. It stands on Castle Rock, which has been occupied by humans since at least the Iron Age. There has been a royal castle on the rock since the reign of Malcolm III in the 11th century, and the castle continued to be a royal residence until 1633. From the 15th century, the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as a military garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half.\nEdinburgh Castle has played a prominent role in Scottish history, and has served variously as a royal residence, an arsenal, a treasury, a national archive, a mint, a prison, a military fortress, and the home of the Honours of Scotland – the Scottish regalia. As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, the castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745. Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1,100-year history, giving it a claim to having been \"the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world\".[4] Few of the present buildings pre-date the Lang Siege of 1573, when the medieval defences were largely destroyed by artillery bombardment. The most notable exceptions are St Margaret's Chapel from the early 12th century, which is regarded as the oldest building in Edinburgh,[5] the Royal Palace, and the early 16th-century Great Hall. The castle is the site of the Scottish National War Memorial and the National War Museum. The British Army is still responsible for some parts of the castle, although its presence is now largely ceremonial and administrative. The castle is the regimental headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and houses their regimental museums, along with that of the Royal Scots.\nThe castle, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland, is Scotland's most (and the United Kingdom's second most) visited paid tourist attraction, with over 2.2 million visitors in 2019[6] and over 70 percent of leisure visitors to Edinburgh visiting the castle.[7] As the backdrop to the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo during the annual Edinburgh Festival, the castle has become a recognisable symbol of Edinburgh in particular and of Scotland as a whole.\nHistory\nPre-history of the Castle Rock\nGeology\nMain article: Castle Rock, Edinburgh\nDiagram of a crag and tail feature, such as the Castle Rock: A is the crag formed from the volcanic plug, B is the tail of softer rock, and C shows the direction of ice movement. In the case of Edinburgh, the castle stands on the crag (A) with the Royal Mile extending along the tail (B)\nThe castle stands upon the plug of an extinct volcano, which is estimated to have risen about 350 million years ago during the lower Carboniferous period. The Castle Rock is the remains of a volcanic pipe, which cut through the surrounding sedimentary rock before cooling to form very hard dolerite, a type of basalt. Subsequent glacial erosion was resisted by the dolerite, which protected the softer rock to the east, leaving a crag and tail formation.[8]\nThe summit of the Castle Rock is 130 metres (430 ft) above sea level, with rocky cliffs to the south, west, and north, rising to a height of 80 metres (260 ft) above the surrounding landscape.[9] This means that the only readily accessible route to the castle lies to the east, where the ridge slopes more gently. The defensive advantage of such a site is self-evident, but the geology of the rock also presents difficulties, since basalt is extremely impermeable. Providing water to the Upper Ward of the castle was problematic, and despite the sinking of a 34-metre (112 ft) deep well, the water supply often ran out during drought or siege,[10] including during the Lang Siege in 1573.[11]\nEarliest habitation\nSee also: Prehistoric Scotland and Castle of Maidens\nThe castle is built on a volcanic rock, as seen here in a 19th-century view from the Grassmarket area\nan Archaeological investigation has yet to establish when the Castle Rock was first used for human habitation. There is no record of any Roman interest in the location during General Agricola's invasion of northern Britain near the end of the 1st century AD. Ptolemy's map of the 2nd century AD[12] shows a settlement in the territory of the Votadini named \"Alauna\", meaning \"rock place\", making this possibly the earliest known name for the Castle Rock.[13] This could, however, refer to another of the tribe's hill forts in the area. The Orygynale Cronykil of Andrew of Wyntoun (c. 1350 – c. 1423), an early source for Scottish history, names \"Ebrawce\" (Ebraucus), a legendary King of the Britons, as having \"byggyd [built] Edynburgh\".[14] According to the earlier chronicler, Geoffrey of Monmouth (c. 1100 – c. 1155), Ebraucus had fifty children by his twenty wives, and was the founder of \"Kaerebrauc\" (York), \"Alclud\" (Dumbarton) and the \"Maidens' Castle\".[15] The 16th-century English writer John Stow (c. 1525 – 1605), credited Ebraucus with building \"the Castell of Maidens called Edenbrough\" in 989 BC.[16] The name \"Maidens' Castle\" (Latin: Castra or Castellum Puellarum) occurs frequently up until the 16th century.[17] It appears in charters of David I (r. 1124–1153) and his successors in the Kingdom of Scotland,[18] although the reason for it is not known. William Camden's survey of Britain, Britannia (1607), records that \"the Britans called [it] Castle Myned Agned [winged rock], the Scots, the Maidens Castle and the Virgins Castle, of certaine young maidens of the Picts roiall bloud who were kept there in old time\".[19] According to the 17th-century antiquarian Father Richard Hay, the \"maidens\" were a group of nuns, who were ejected from the castle and replaced by canons, considered \"fitter to live among soldiers\".[20] However, this story was considered \"apocryphal\" by the 19th-century antiquarian Daniel Wilson and has been ignored by historians since.[21] The name may have been derived from a \"Cult of the Nine Maidens\" type of legend. Arthurian legends suggest that the site once held a shrine to Morgain la Fee, one of nine sisters.[22] Later, St Monenna, said to be one of nine companions, reputedly invested a church at Edinburgh, as well as at Dumbarton and other places.[23] Similar names are shared by many other Iron Age hillforts and may have simply described a castle that had never been taken by force[24] or derived from an earlier Brittonic name like mag dun.[25][26]\nThe Castle seen from the North\nAn archaeological excavation in the early 1990s uncovered evidence of the site having been settled during the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age, potentially making Castle Rock the longest continuously occupied site in Scotland.[27] However, the extent of the finds was not particularly significant and insufficient to draw any certain conclusions about the precise nature or scale of this earliest known phase of occupation.[28]\nThe archaeological evidence is more reliable concerning the Iron Age. Traditionally, it had been supposed that the tribes of central Scotland had made little or no use of the Castle Rock. Excavations at nearby Dunsapie Hill, Duddingston, Inveresk and Traprain Law had revealed relatively large settlements and it was supposed that these sites had been chosen in preference to the Castle Rock. However, the excavation in the 1990s pointed to the probable existence of an enclosed hillfort on the rock, although only the fringes of the site were excavated. House fragments revealed were similar to Iron Age dwellings previously found in Northumbria.[29]\nThe 1990s dig revealed clear signs of habitation from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, consistent with Ptolemy's reference to \"Alauna\". Signs of occupation included some Roman material, including pottery, bronzes and brooches, implying a possible trading relationship between the Votadini and the Romans beginning with Agricola's northern campaign in AD 82, and continuing through to the establishment of the Antonine Wall around AD 140. The nature of the settlement in this period is inconclusive, but Driscoll and Yeoman suggest it may have been a broch, similar to the one at Edin's Hall near Duns in the Scottish Borders.[30]\nEarly Middle Ages\nMap of northern Britain showing the Gododdin and other tribes c.600 AD\nThe castle does not re-appear in contemporary historical records from the time of Ptolemy until around AD 600. Then, in the epic Welsh poem Y Gododdin there is a reference to Din Eidyn, \"the stronghold of Eidyn\". This has been generally assumed to refer to the Castle Rock.[31] The poem tells of the Gododdin King Mynyddog Mwynfawr,[32] and his band of warriors, who, after a year of feasting in their fortress, set out to do battle with the Angles at \"Catreath\" (possibly Catterick) in Yorkshire. Despite performing glorious deeds of valour and bravery, the poem relates that the Gododdin were massacred.[33]\nThe Irish annals record that in 638, after the events related in Y Gododdin, \"Etin\" was besieged by the Angles under Oswald of Northumbria, and the Gododdin were defeated.[34] The territory around Edinburgh then became part of the Kingdom of Northumbria, which was itself absorbed by England in the 10th century. Lothian became part of Scotland, during the reign of Indulf (r.954–962).[35]\nThe archaeological evidence for the period in question is based entirely on the analysis of middens (domestic refuse heaps), with no evidence of structures. Few conclusions can therefore be derived about the status of the settlement during this period, although the midden deposits show no clear break since Roman times.[36]\nHigh Middle Ages\nFurther information: Scotland in the High Middle Ages\nSt Margaret, depicted in a stained glass window in the chapel of Edinburgh Castle\nThe first documentary reference to a castle at Edinburgh is John of Fordun's account of the death of King Malcolm III (1031–1093). Fordun describes his widow, the future Saint Margaret, as residing at the \"Castle of Maidens\" when she is brought news of his death in November 1093. Fordun's account goes on to relate how Margaret died of grief within days, and how Malcolm's brother Donald Bane laid siege to the castle. However, Fordun's chronicle was not written until the later 14th century, and the near-contemporary account of the life of St Margaret by Bishop Turgot makes no mention of a castle.[37] During the reigns of Malcolm III and his sons, Edinburgh Castle became one of the most significant royal centres in Scotland.[38] Malcolm's son King Edgar died here in 1107.[39]\nMalcolm's youngest son, King David I (r.1124–1153), developed Edinburgh as a seat of royal power principally through his administrative reforms (termed by some modern scholars the Davidian Revolution).[40] Between 1139 and 1150, David held an assembly of nobles and churchmen, a precursor to the parliament of Scotland, at the castle.[38] Any buildings or defences would probably have been of timber,[41] although two stone buildings are documented as having existed in the 12th century. Of these, St. Margaret's Chapel remains at the summit of the rock. The second was a church, dedicated to St. Mary, which stood on the site of the Scottish National War Memorial.[41] Given that the southern part of the Upper Ward (where Crown Square is now sited) was not suited to be built upon until the construction of the vaults in the 15th century, it seems probable that any earlier buildings would have been located towards the northern part of the rock; that is around the area where St. Margaret's Chapel stands. This has been suggested that the chapel is the last remnant of a square, stone keep, which would have formed the bulk of the 12th-century fortification.[42] The structure may have been similar to the keep of Carlisle Castle, which David I began after 1135.[43]\nDavid's successor King Malcolm IV (r.1153–1165) reportedly stayed at Edinburgh more than at any other location.[39] But in 1174, King William \"the Lion\" (r.1165–1214) was captured by the English at the Battle of Alnwick. He was forced to sign the Treaty of Falaise to secure his release, in return for surrendering Edinburgh Castle, along with the castles of Berwick, Roxburgh and Stirling, to the English King, Henry II. The castle was occupied by the English for twelve years, until 1186, when it was returned to William as the dowry of his English bride, Ermengarde de Beaumont, who had been chosen for him by King Henry.[44] By the end of the 12th century, Edinburgh Castle was established as the main repository of Scotland's official state papers.[45]\nWars of Scottish Independence\nStatues of Robert the Bruce by Thomas Clapperton and William Wallace by Alexander Carrick were added to the Gatehouse entrance in 1929\nA century later, in 1286, on the death of King Alexander III, the throne of Scotland became vacant. Edward I of England was appointed to adjudicate the competing claims for the Scottish crown, but used the opportunity to attempt to establish himself as the feudal overlord of Scotland. During the negotiations, Edward stayed briefly at Edinburgh Castle and may have received homage there from the Scottish nobles.[46]\nIn March 1296, Edward I invaded Scotland, unleashing the First War of Scottish Independence. Edinburgh Castle soon came under English control, surrendering after a three-day-long bombardment.[47] Following the siege, Edward had many Scottish legal records and royal treasures moved from the castle to England.[46] A large garrison numbering 325 men was installed in 1300.[48] Edward also brought to Scotland his master builders of the Welsh castles, including Thomas de Houghton and Master Walter of Hereford, both of whom travelled from Wales to Edinburgh.[49] After the death of Edward I in 1307, however, England's control over Scotland weakened. On 14 March 1314, a surprise night attack by Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray recaptured the castle. John Barbour's narrative poem The Brus relates how a party of thirty hand-picked men was guided by one William Francis, a member of the garrison who knew of a route along the north face of the Castle Rock and a place where the wall might be scaled. Making the difficult ascent, Randolph's men scaled the wall, surprised the garrison and took control.[50] Robert the Bruce immediately ordered the slighting of the castle to prevent its re-occupation by the English.[51] Four months later, his army secured victory at the Battle of Bannockburn.[52][53]\nAfter Bruce's death in 1329, Edward III of England determined to renew the attempted subjugation of Scotland and supported the claim of Edward Balliol, son of the former King John Balliol, over that of Bruce's young son David II. Edward invaded in 1333, marking the start of the Second War of Scottish Independence, and the English forces reoccupied and refortified Edinburgh Castle in 1335,[54] holding it until 1341. This time, the Scottish assault was led by William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale. Douglas's party disguised themselves as merchants from Leith bringing supplies to the garrison. Driving a cart into the entrance, they halted it there to prevent the gates from closing. A larger force hidden nearby rushed to join them and the castle was retaken.[44] The 100 English men of the garrison were all killed.[54]\nDavid's Tower and the 15th century\nThe 1357 Treaty of Berwick brought the Wars of Independence to a close. David II resumed his rule and set about rebuilding Edinburgh Castle which became his principal seat of government.[55] David's Tower was begun around 1367, and was incomplete when David died at the castle in 1371. It was completed by his successor, Robert II, in the 1370s. The tower stood on the site of the present Half Moon Battery connected by a section of curtain wall to the smaller Constable's Tower, a round tower built between 1375 and 1379 where the Portcullis Gate now stands.[44][56]\nA late-16th-century depiction of the castle, from Braun & Hogenberg's Civitates orbis terrarum, showing David's Tower at the centre\nIn the early 15th century, another English invasion, this time under Henry IV, reached Edinburgh Castle and began a siege, but eventually withdrew due to lack of supplies.[44] At least by 1436-7, Sir William Crichton was Keeper or Governor of Edinburgh Castle,[57] and soon after became Chancellor of Scotland. In an attempt to gain the regency of Scotland, Crichton sought to break the power of the Douglases, the principal noble family in the kingdom. The 16-year-old William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas, and his younger brother David were summoned to Edinburgh Castle in November 1440. After the so-called \"Black Dinner\" had taken place in David's Tower, both boys were summarily executed on trumped-up charges in the presence of the 10-year-old King James II (r.1437–1460). Douglas' supporters subsequently besieged the castle, inflicting damage.[58] Construction continued throughout this period, with the area now known as Crown Square being laid out over vaults in the 1430s. Royal apartments were built, forming the nucleus of the later palace block, and a Great Hall was in existence by 1458. In 1464, access to the castle was improved when the current approach road up the north-east side of the rock was created to allow easier movement of the royal artillery train in and out of the area now known as the Upper Ward.[56]\nIn 1479, Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, was imprisoned in David's Tower for plotting against his brother, King James III (r.1460–1488). He escaped by getting his guards drunk, and then lowering himself from a window on a rope.[58] The duke fled to France, then England, where he allied himself with King Edward IV. In 1482, Albany marched into Scotland with Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later King Richard III), and an English army. James III was trapped in the castle from 22 July to 29 September 1482 until he successfully negotiated a settlement.[58]\nEdinburgh Castle as it may have looked before the Lang Siege of 1571–73, with David's Tower and the Palace block, centre and left\nDuring the 15th century, the castle was increasingly used as an arsenal and armaments factory.[59] The first known purchase of a gun was in 1384, and the \"great bombard\" Mons Meg was delivered to Edinburgh in 1457.[60] The first recorded mention of an armoury for the manufacture of guns occurs in 1474, and by 1498 the master gunner Robert Borthwick was casting bronze guns at Edinburgh.[61] By 1511 Edinburgh was the principal foundry in Scotland, supplanting Stirling Castle, with Scottish and European smiths working under Borthwick, who by 1512 was appointed \"master melter of the king's guns\".[62] Their output included guns for the Scottish flagship, the \"Great Michael\", and the \"Seven Sisters\", a set of cannons captured by the English at Flodden in 1513.[63] Sir Thomas Howard, England's Lord Admiral, admired their graceful shape and brilliant finish, declaring them the most beautiful [cannon] for their size and length that he had ever seen.[64] From 1510 Dutch craftsmen were also producing hand culverins, an early firearm.[65] After Flodden, Borthwick continued his work, producing an unknown number of guns, but none have survived. He was succeeded by French smiths, who began manufacturing hagbuts (another type of firearm) in the 1550s,[66] and by 1541 the castle had a stock of 413.[67]\nMeanwhile, the royal family began to stay more frequently at the Abbey of Holyrood, about 1 mile (1.6 km) from the castle. Around the end of the fifteenth century, King James IV (r.1488–1513) built the Palace of Holyroodhouse, by the abbey, as his principal Edinburgh residence and the castle's role as a royal home subsequently declined.[58] James IV did, however, construct the Great Hall, which was completed in the early 16th century,[56] and the castle featured in his tournaments of the Wild Knight and the Black Lady.[68] His daughter Margaret Stewart was lodged in the castle with her servant Ellen More.[69]\n16th century and the Lang Siege\nSir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, who held the castle on behalf of Queen Mary during the Lang Siege of 1571–73. Painting by Jean Clouet\nJames IV was killed in battle at Flodden Field, on 9 September 1513. Expecting the English to press their advantage, the Scots hastily constructed a town wall around Edinburgh and augmented the castle's defences. Robert Borthwick and a Frenchman, Antoine d'Arces, were involved in designing new artillery defences and fortifications in 1514, though it appears from lack of evidence that little of the planned work was carried out.[70] Three years later, King James V (r.1513–1542), still only five years old, was brought to the castle for safety.[58] Upon his death 25 years later, the crown passed to his week-old daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots. English invasions followed, as King Henry VIII attempted to force a dynastic marriage on Scotland.[56] When the English burnt Edinburgh in May 1544 the gunner Andrew Mansioun firing from the castle destroyed an English cannon placed to bombard the forework.[71] In 1547 disaffected members of the garrison who resented Regent Arran came to Norham Castle and offered to let the English in.[72]\nRefortification in 1548 included an earthen angle-bastion, known as the Spur, of the type known as trace italienne, one of the earliest examples in Britain.[73] Brunstane Castle the home of the traitor Alexander Crichton was demolished to provide building materials.[74] The Spur may have been designed by Migliorino Ubaldini, an Italian engineer from the court of Henry II of France,[73] and was said to have the arms of France carved on it.[75] James V's widow, Mary of Guise, acted as regent from 1554 until her death at the castle in 1560.[58]\nThe following year, the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, returned from France to begin her reign, which was marred by crises and quarrels among the powerful Protestant Scottish nobility. In 1565, the Queen made an unpopular marriage with Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and the following year, in a small room of the Palace at Edinburgh Castle, she gave birth to their son James, who would later be King of both Scotland and England. Mary's reign was, however, brought to an abrupt end. Three months after the murder of Darnley at Kirk o' Field in 1567, she married James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, one of the chief murder suspects. A large proportion of the nobility rebelled, resulting ultimately in the imprisonment and forced abdication of Mary at Lochleven Castle. She escaped and fled to England, but some of the nobility remained faithful to her cause. Edinburgh Castle was initially handed by its captain, James Balfour, to the Regent Moray, who had forced Mary's abdication and now held power in the name of the infant King James VI. Shortly after the Battle of Langside, in May 1568, Moray appointed Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange Keeper of the Castle.[58]\nDetail from a contemporary drawing of Edinburgh Castle under siege in 1573, showing it surrounded by attacking batteries\nGrange was a trusted lieutenant of the Regent, but after Moray's murder in January 1570 his allegiance to the King's cause began to waver. Intermittent civil war continued between the supporters of the two monarchs, and in April 1571 Dumbarton Castle fell to \"the King's men\". Under the influence of William Maitland of Lethington, Mary's secretary, Grange changed sides, occupying the town and castle of Edinburgh for Queen Mary, and against the new regent, the Earl of Lennox.[76] The stand-off which followed was not resolved until two years later, and became known as the \"Lang Siege\", from the Scots word for \"long\". Hostilities began in May, with a month-long siege of the town, and a second short siege in October. Blockades and skirmishing continued meanwhile, and Grange continued to refortify the castle. The King's party appealed to Elizabeth I of England for assistance, as they lacked the artillery and money required to reduce the castle, and feared that Grange would receive aid from France and the Duke of Alba in the Spanish Netherlands.[77] Elizabeth sent ambassadors to negotiate, and in July 1572 a truce was agreed and the blockade lifted. The town was effectively surrendered to the King's party, with Grange confined to the castle.[78]\nThe truce expired on 1 January 1573, and Grange began bombarding the town. His supplies of powder and shot, however, were running low, and despite having 40 cannons available, there were only seven gunners in the garrison.[79] The King's forces, now with the Earl of Morton in charge as regent, were making headway with plans for a siege. Trenches were dug to surround the castle, and St Margaret's Well was poisoned.[80] By February, all Queen Mary's other supporters had surrendered to the Regent, but Grange resolved to resist despite water shortages within the castle. The garrison continued to bombard the town, killing a number of citizens. They also made sorties to set fires, burning 100 houses in the town and then firing on anyone attempting to put out the flames.[81]\nSir William Drury, commander of Elizabeth I of England's Protestant troops who brought the Lang Siege to an end in 1573. Unknown artist\nIn April, a force of around 1,000 English troops, led by Sir William Drury, arrived in Edinburgh. They were followed by 27 cannons from Berwick-upon-Tweed,[79] including one that had been cast within Edinburgh Castle and captured by the English at Flodden.[58] The English troops built an artillery emplacement on Castle Hill, immediately facing the east walls of the castle, and five others to the north, west and south. By 17 May these batteries were ready, and the bombardment began. Over the next 12 days, the gunners dispatched around 3,000 shots at the castle.[11] On 22 May, the south wall of David's Tower collapsed, and the next day the Constable's Tower also fell. The debris blocked the castle entrance, as well as the Fore Well, although this had already run dry.[11] On 26 May, the English attacked and captured the Spur, the outer fortification of the castle, which had been isolated by the collapse. The following day Grange emerged from the castle by a ladder after calling for a ceasefire to allow negotiations for a surrender to take place. When it was made clear that he would not be allowed to go free even if he ended the siege, Grange resolved to continue the resistance, but the garrison threatened to mutiny. He therefore arranged for Drury and his men to enter the castle on 28 May, preferring to surrender to the English rather than the Regent Morton.[82] Edinburgh Castle was handed over to George Douglas of Parkhead, the Regent's brother, and the garrison was allowed to go free.[83] In contrast, Kirkcaldy of Grange, his brother James and two jewellers, James Mossman and James Cokke, who had been minting coins in Mary's name inside the castle, were hanged at the Cross in Edinburgh on 3 August.[84]\nNova Scotia and Civil War\nMuch of the castle was subsequently rebuilt by Regent Morton, including the Spur, the new Half Moon Battery and the Portcullis Gate. Some of these works were supervised by William MacDowall, the master of work who fifteen years earlier had repaired David's Tower.[85] The Half Moon Battery, while impressive in size, is considered by historians to have been an ineffective and outdated artillery fortification.[86] This may have been due to a shortage of resources, although the battery's position obscuring the ancient David's Tower and enhancing the prominence of the palace block, has been seen as a significant decision.[87]\nThe battered palace block remained unused, particularly after James VI departed to become King of England in 1603.[88] James had repairs carried out in 1584, and in 1615–1616 more extensive repairs were carried out in preparation for his return visit to Scotland.[89] The mason William Wallace and master of works James Murray introduced an early Scottish example of the double-pile block.[90] The principal external features were the three, three-storey oriel windows on the east façade, facing the town and emphasising that this was a palace rather than just a place of defence.[91] During his visit in 1617, James held court in the refurbished palace block, but still preferred to sleep at Holyrood.[56]\nMemorial plaque to Sir William Alexander, on the Castle Esplanade\nIn 1621, King James granted Sir William Alexander the land in North America between New England and Newfoundland, as Nova Scotia (\"New Scotland\"). To promote the settlement and plantation of the new territory, the Baronetage of Nova Scotia was created in 1624. Under Scots law, baronets had to \"take sasine\" by symbolically receiving the earth and stone of the land of which they were baronet. To make this possible, since Nova Scotia was so distant, the King declared that sasine could be taken either in the new province or alternatively \"at the castle of Edinburgh as the most eminent and principal place of Scotland.\"[92]\nJames' successor, King Charles I, visited Edinburgh Castle only once, hosting a feast in the Great Hall and staying the night before his Scottish coronation in 1633. This was the last occasion that a reigning monarch resided in the castle.[58] In 1639, in response to Charles' attempts to impose Episcopacy on the Scottish Church, civil war broke out between the King's forces and the Presbyterian Covenanters. The Covenanters, led by Alexander Leslie, captured Edinburgh Castle after a short siege, although it was restored to Charles after the Peace of Berwick in June the same year. The peace was short-lived, however, and the following year the Covenanters took the castle again, this time after a three-month siege, during which the garrison ran out of supplies. The Spur was badly damaged and was demolished in the 1640s.[56] The Royalist commander James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose, was imprisoned here after his capture in 1650.[93]\nIn May 1650, the Covenanters signed the Treaty of Breda, allying themselves with the exiled Charles II against the English Parliamentarians, who had executed his father the previous year. In response to the Scots proclaiming Charles King, Oliver Cromwell launched an invasion of Scotland, defeating the Covenanter army at Dunbar in September. Edinburgh Castle was taken after a three-month siege, which caused further damage. The Governor of the Castle, Colonel Walter Dundas, surrendered to Cromwell despite having enough supplies to hold out, allegedly from a desire to change sides.[93]\nGarrison fortress: Jacobites and prisoners of war\nAn engraving of Edinburgh Castle made shortly before the creation of the Esplanade was begun in 1753\nAfter his Restoration in 1660, Charles II opted to maintain a full-time standing army based on Cromwell's New Model Army. From this time until 1923, a garrison was continuously maintained at the castle.[94] The medieval royal castle was transformed into a garrison fortress, but continued to see military and political action. The Marquis of Argyll was imprisoned here in 1661, when King Charles II settled old scores with his enemies following his return to the throne. Twenty years later, Argyll's son, the 9th Earl of Argyll, was also imprisoned in the castle for religious Nonconformism in the reign of King James VII. He escaped by disguising himself as his sister's footman, but was recaptured and returned to the castle after his failed rebellion to oust James from the throne in 1685.[93]\nJames VII was deposed and exiled by the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which installed William of Orange as King of England. Not long after, in early 1689, the Estates of Scotland, after convening to accept William formally as their new king, demanded that Duke of Gordon, Governor of the Castle, surrender the fortress. Gordon, who had been appointed by James VII as a fellow Catholic, refused. In March 1689, the castle was blockaded by 7,000 troops against a garrison of 160 men, further weakened by religious disputes. On 18 March, Viscount Dundee, intent on raising a rebellion in the Highlands, climbed up the western side of the Castle Rock to urge Gordon to hold the castle against the new King.[95] Gordon agreed, but during the ensuing siege he refused to fire upon the town, while the besiegers inflicted little damage on the castle. Despite Dundee's initial successes in the north, Gordon eventually surrendered on 14 June, due to dwindling supplies and having lost 70 men during the three-month siege.[96][97]\nEdinburgh Castle with the Nor Loch in foreground, around 1780, by Alexander Nasmyth\nThe castle was almost taken in the first Jacobite rising in support of James Stuart, the \"Old Pretender\", in 1715. On 8 September, just two days after the rising began, a party of around 100 Jacobite Highlanders, led by Lord Drummond, attempted to scale the walls with the assistance of members of the garrison. However, the rope ladder lowered by the castle sentries was too short, and the alarm was raised after a change of the watch. The Jacobites fled, while the deserters within the castle were hanged or flogged.[98] In 1728, General Wade reported that the castle's defences were decayed and inadequate,[93] and a major strengthening of the fortifications was carried out throughout the 1720s and 1730s. This was the period when most of the artillery defences and bastions on the north and west sides of the castle were built. These were designed by military engineer Captain John Romer, and built by the architect William Adam. They include the Argyle Battery, Mills Mount Battery, the Low Defences and the Western Defences.[99]\nThe last military action at the castle took place during the second Jacobite rising of 1745. The Jacobite army, under Charles Edward Stuart (\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\"), captured Edinburgh without a fight in September 1745, but the castle remained in the hands of its ageing Deputy Governor, General George Preston, who refused to surrender.[100] After their victory over the government army at Prestonpans on 21 September, the Jacobites attempted to blockade the castle. Preston's response was to bombard Jacobite positions within the town. After several buildings had been demolished and four people killed, Charles called off the blockade.[101][102] The Jacobites themselves had no heavy guns with which to respond, and by November they had marched into England, leaving Edinburgh to the castle garrison.[103]\nOver the next century, the castle vaults were used to hold prisoners of war during several conflicts, including the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the American War of Independence (1775–1783) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815).[104] During this time, several new buildings were erected within the castle, including powder magazines, stores, the Governor's House (1742),[105] and the New Barracks (1796–1799).[106]\n19th century to the present\nKing George IV waves from the battlements of the Half Moon Battery in 1822, drawn by James Skene\nA mass prison break in 1811, in which 49 prisoners of war escaped via a hole in the south wall, persuaded the authorities that the castle vaults were no longer suitable as a prison. This use ceased in 1814[107] and the castle began gradually to assume a different role as a national monument. In 1818, Sir Walter Scott was given permission to search the castle for the Crown of Scotland, believed lost after the union of Scotland and England in 1707. Breaking into a sealed room, now known as the Crown Room, and unlocking a chest within, he rediscovered the Honours of Scotland, which were then put on public display with an entry charge of one shilling.[108] In 1822, King George IV made a visit to Edinburgh, becoming the first reigning monarch to visit the castle since Charles II in 1651. In 1829, the cannon Mons Meg was returned from the Tower of London, where it had been taken as part of the process of disarming Scotland after \"the '45\", and the palace began to be opened up to visitors during the 1830s.[109] St Margaret's Chapel was \"rediscovered\" in 1845, having been used as a store for many years.[108] Works in the 1880s, funded by the Edinburgh publisher William Nelson and carried out by Hippolyte Blanc, saw the Argyle Tower built over the Portcullis Gate and the Great Hall restored after years of use as a barracks.[56] A new Gatehouse was built in 1888. During the 19th century, several schemes were put forward for rebuilding the whole castle as a Scottish baronial style château. Work began in 1858, but was soon abandoned, and only the hospital building was eventually remodelled in 1897.[56] Following the death of Prince Albert in 1861, the architect David Bryce put forward a proposal for a 50-metre (160 ft) keep as a memorial, but Queen Victoria objected and the scheme was not pursued.[110]\nSoldiers of the 92nd Regiment of Foot (later Gordon Highlanders) while on garrison duty at the castle in 1845.[111]\nEdinburgh Castle, waxed-paper negative by Thomas Keith, c. 1855. Department of Image Collections, National Gallery of Art Library, Washington DC\nIn 1905, responsibility for the castle was transferred from the War Office to the Office of Works,[112] although the garrison remained until 1923, when the troops moved to Redford Barracks in south-west Edinburgh. The castle was again used as a prison during the First World War, when \"Red Clydesider\" David Kirkwood was confined in the military prison block, and during the Second World War, when downed German Luftwaffe pilots were captured.[113] The position of Governor of Edinburgh Castle, vacant since 1876, was revived in 1935 as an honorary title for the General Officer Commanding in Scotland, the first holder being Lieutenant-General Sir Archibald Cameron of Lochiel.[114] The castle passed into the care of Historic Scotland when it was established in 1991, and was designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1993.[115] The buildings and structures of the castle are further protected by 24 separate listings, including 13 at category A, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland,[116] and special care was taken when installing 31 kW solar panels on the roof of the War Memorial, obscured by its parapet.[117] The Old and New Towns of Edinburgh, a World Heritage Site inscribed by UNESCO in 1995, is described as \"dominated by a medieval fortress\".[118]\nDescription\nThe Castle dominates the city skyline\nEdinburgh Castle is located at the top of the Royal Mile, at the west end of Edinburgh's Old Town. The volcanic Castle Rock offers a naturally defended position, with sheer cliffs to north and south, and a steep ascent from the west. The only easy approach is from the town to the east, and the castle's defences are situated accordingly, with a series of gates protecting the route to the summit of the Castle Rock.[119]\nPlan of Edinburgh Castle Key: A Esplanade · B Gatehouse · C Ticket office · D Portcullis Gate & Argyle Tower · E Argyle Battery · F Mills Mount Battery & One o'Clock Gun · G Cartsheds · H Western Defences · I Hospital · J Butts Battery · K Scottish National War Museum · L Governors House · M New Barracks · N Military Prison · O Royal Scots Museum · P Foog's Gate · Q Reservoirs · R Mons Meg · S Pet Cemetery · T St. Margaret's Chapel · U Half Moon Battery · V Crown Square · W Royal Palace · X Great Hall · Y Queen Anne Building · Z Scottish National War Memorial Outer defences\nIn front of the castle is a long sloping forecourt known as the Esplanade. Originally the Spur, a 16th-century hornwork, was located here. The present Esplanade was laid out as a parade ground in 1753, and extended in 1845.[56] It is upon this Esplanade that the Edinburgh Military Tattoo takes place annually. From the Esplanade the Half Moon Battery is prominent, with the Royal Palace to its left.[120]\nMain gate from the Esplanade into the castle (with the gatehouse)\nThe Gatehouse at the head of the Esplanade was built as an architecturally cosmetic addition to the castle in 1888.[121] Statues of Robert the Bruce by Thomas Clapperton and William Wallace by Alexander Carrick were added in 1929, and the Latin motto Nemo me impune lacessit is inscribed above the gate. The dry ditch in front of the entrance was completed in its present form in 1742.[122] Within the Gatehouse are offices, and to the north is the most recent addition to the castle; the ticket office, completed in 2008 to a design by Gareth Hoskins Architects.[123] The road, built by James III in 1464 for the transport of cannon, leads upward and around to the north of the Half Moon Battery and the Forewall Battery, to the Portcullis Gate. In 1990, an alternative access was opened by digging a tunnel from the north of the esplanade to the north-west part of the castle, separating visitor traffic from service traffic.[124]\nPortcullis Gate and Argyle Tower\nThe Portcullis Gate\nThe Portcullis Gate was begun by the Regent Morton after the Lang Siege of 1571–73 to replace the round Constable's Tower, which was destroyed in the siege.[125] In 1584 the upper parts of the Gatehouse were completed by William Schaw,[126] and these were further modified in 1750.[127] In 1886–1887 this plain building was replaced with a Scots Baronial tower, designed by the architect Hippolyte Blanc, although the original Portcullis Gate remains below. The new structure was named the Argyle Tower, from the fact that the 9th Earl of Argyll had been held here prior to his execution in 1685.[128] Described as \"restoration in an extreme form\",[128] the rebuilding of the Argyle Tower was the first in a series of works funded by the publisher William Nelson.[128]\nJust inside the gate is the Argyle Battery overlooking Princes Street, with Mills Mount Battery, the location of the One O'Clock Gun, to the west. Below these is the Low Defence, while at the base of the rock is the ruined Wellhouse Tower, built in 1362 to guard St. Margaret's Well.[129] This natural spring provided an important secondary source of water for the castle, the water being lifted up by a crane mounted on a platform known as the Crane Bastion.[130]\nMilitary buildings\nGovernor's House (1742)\nThe areas to the north and west of the Argyle Tower are largely occupied by military buildings erected after the castle became a major garrison in the early 18th century.[131] Adjacent to Mills Mount are the 18th-century cart sheds, now tea rooms.[122] The Governor's House to the south was built in 1742 as accommodation for the Governor, Storekeeper, and Master Gunner,[132] and was used until the post of Governor became vacant in the later 19th century; it was then used by nurses of the castle hospital. Today, it functions as an officers' mess, and as the office of the Governor since the restoration of the post in 1936.[133]\nThe New Barracks (1799)\nSouth of the Governor's House is the New Barracks, completed in 1799 to house 600 soldiers, and replacing the outdated accommodation in the Great Hall. They now house the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys) as well as the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum. The latter was opened in 1995 by the regiment's Colonel, Queen Elizabeth II.[134] Also nearby, in the former Royal Scots drill hall, constructed in 1900, is the Regimental Museum of the Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment).[135] The military prison was built in 1842 as a detention block for the castle garrison and was extended in the 1880s. It was last used in 1923, when the garrison moved to the city's Redford Barracks.[109]\nNational War Museum of Scotland\nMain article: National War Museum\nWest of the Governor's House, a store for munitions was built in 1747–48 and later extended to form a courtyard, in which the main gunpowder magazine also stood.[136] In 1897 the area was remodelled as a military hospital, formerly housed in the Great Hall. The building to the south of this courtyard is now the National War Museum of Scotland, which forms part of the National Museums of Scotland. It was formerly known as the Scottish United Services Museum, and, prior to this, the Scottish Naval and Military Museum, when it was located in the Queen Anne Building.[137] It covers Scotland's military history over the past 400 years, and includes a wide range of military artefacts, such as uniforms, medals and weapons. The exhibits also illustrate the history and causes behind the many wars in which Scottish soldiers have been involved. Beside the museum is Butts Battery, named after the archery butts (targets) formerly placed here.[138] Below it are the Western Defences, where a postern, named the West Sally Port, gives access to the western slope of the rock.[139]\nUpper Ward\nFoog's Gate\nThe Upper Ward or Citadel occupies the highest part of the Castle Rock, and is entered via the late 17th-century Foog's Gate.[122] The origin of this name is unknown, although it was formerly known as the Foggy Gate, which may relate to the dense sea-fogs, known as haars, which commonly affect Edinburgh.[140] Adjacent to the gates are the large cisterns built to reduce the castle's dependency on well water and a former fire station, now used as a shop. The summit of the rock is occupied by St Margaret's Chapel and 15th-century siege gun Mons Meg. On a ledge below this area is a small 19th-century Dogs' Cemetery for the burial of the soldiers' regimental mascots. Besides this, the Lang Stair leads down to the Argyle Battery, past a section of a medieval bastion,[122] and gives access to the upper storey of the Argyle Tower. The eastern end of the Upper Ward is occupied by the Forewall and Half Moon Batteries, with Crown Square to the south.[120]\nSt. Margaret's Chapel\nSt. Margaret's Chapel\nMain article: St. Margaret's Chapel\nThe oldest building in the castle and in Edinburgh is the small St. Margaret's Chapel.[5] One of the few 12th-century structures surviving in any Scottish castle,[43] it dates from the reign of King David I (r.1124–1153), who built it as a private chapel for the royal family and dedicated it to his mother, Saint Margaret of Scotland, who died in the castle in 1093. It survived the slighting of 1314, when the castle's defences were destroyed on the orders of Robert the Bruce, and was used as a gunpowder store from the 16th century when the present roof was built. In 1845, it was \"discovered\" by the antiquary Daniel Wilson, while in use as part of the larger garrison chapel, and was restored in 1851–1852.[56] The chapel is still used for religious ceremonies, such as weddings.[141] Mons Meg\nMain article: Mons Meg\nThe siege gun Mons Meg, described in a 17th-century document as \"the great iron murderer called Muckle-Meg\" (muckle being Scots for 'big')\nThe 15th-century siege gun or bombard known as Mons Meg is displayed on a terrace in front of St. Margaret's Chapel. It was constructed in the Flanders on the orders of Philip III, Duke of Burgundy, in 1449, and given as a gift to King James II, the husband of his niece, in 1457.[60] The 13,000-pound (5.9 t) gun rests on a reconstructed carriage, the details of which were copied from an old stone relief that can be seen inside the tunnel of the Gatehouse at the castle entrance. Some of Meg's large gun stones, weighing around 330 pounds (150 kg) each,[142] are displayed alongside it. On 3 July 1558, it was fired in salute to celebrate the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the French dauphin, François II. The royal Treasurer's Accounts of the time record a payment to soldiers for retrieving one of her stones from Wardie Muir near the Firth of Forth, fully 2 miles (3 km) from the castle.[143] The gun has been defunct since its barrel burst while firing a salute to greet the Duke of Albany, the future King James VII and II, on his arrival in Edinburgh on 30 October 1681.[144]\nHalf Moon Battery and David's Tower\nHalf Moon Battery and Palace Block seen from the Esplanade\nThe Half Moon Battery, which remains a prominent feature on the east side of the castle, was built as part of the reconstruction works supervised by the Regent Morton, and was erected between 1573 and 1588.[122] The Forewall to the north was built between 1689 and 1695 to link the Half Moon to the Portcullis Tower, although part of the original wall of 1540 was incorporated into it.[122] The Half Moon Battery was built around and over the ruins of David's Tower, two storeys of which survive beneath, with windows facing out onto the interior wall of the battery. David's Tower was built on an L-plan, the main block being 51 by 38 feet (16 by 12 m), with a wing measuring 21 by 18 feet (6.4 by 5.5 m) to the west.[122] The entrance was via a pointed-arched doorway in the inner angle, although in the 16th century this was filled in to make the tower a solid rectangle. Prior to the Lang Siege, the tower was recorded as being 59 feet (18 m) high, and the remaining portions stand up to 49 feet (15 m) from the rock.[145]\nThe tower was rediscovered during routine maintenance work in 1912, and excavations below the Half Moon Battery revealed the extent of the surviving buildings. Several rooms are accessible to the public, although the lower parts are generally closed. Outside the tower, but within the battery, is a three-storey room, where large portions of the exterior wall of the tower are still visible, showing shattered masonry caused by the bombardment of 1573.[145] Beside the tower, a section of the former curtain wall was discovered, with a gun loop which overlooked High Street: a recess was made in the outer battery wall to reveal this gun loop. In 1912–1913 the adjacent Fore Well was cleared and surveyed and was found to be 110 feet (34 m) deep, mostly hewn through the rock below the castle.[145]\nCrown Square\nThe Royal Palace in Crown Square\nCrown Square, also known as Palace Yard, was laid out in the 15th century, during the reign of King James III, as the principal courtyard of the castle. The foundations were formed by the construction of a series of large stone vaults built onto the uneven Castle Rock in the 1430s. These vaults were used as a state prison until the 19th century, although more important prisoners were held in the main parts of the castle.[146] The square is formed by the Royal Palace to the east, the Great Hall to the south, the Queen Anne Building to the west, and the National War Memorial to the north.[147]\nRoyal Palace\nThe Royal Palace comprises the former royal apartments, which were the residence of the later Stewart monarchs. It was begun in the mid 15th century, during the reign of James IV,[148] and it originally communicated with David's Tower.[122] The building was extensively remodelled for the visit of James VI to the castle in 1617, when state apartments for the King and Queen were built.[149] On the ground floor is the Laich (low) Hall, now called the King's Dining Room, and a small room, known as the Birth Chamber or Mary Room, where James VI was born to Mary, Queen of Scots, on 19 June 1566. The commemorative painted ceiling and other decorations were added in 1617. On the first floor is the vaulted Crown Room, built in 1615 to house the Honours of Scotland: the crown, the sceptre and the sword of state.[150] The Stone of Scone, upon which the monarchs of Scotland were traditionally crowned, has been kept in the Crown Room since its return to Scotland in 1996. To the south of the palace is the Register House, built in the 1540s to accommodate state archives.[151]\nGreat Hall\nGreat Hall panoramic view-Edinburgh Castle\nThe Great Hall measures 29 by 12.5 metres (95 by 41 ft), and was the chief place of state assembly in the castle, although there is no evidence that the Parliament of Scotland ever met here, as is sometimes reported.[152] Historians have disagreed over its dating, although it is usually ascribed to the reign of King James IV, and is thought to have been completed in the early years of the 16th century.[153] The decorative carved stone corbels supporting the roof have Renaissance detailing, which has been compared to works at Blois, France, of around 1515, indicating that the arts in Scotland were relatively advanced at this time.[152] It is one of only two medieval halls in Scotland with an original hammerbeam roof.[154]\nFollowing Oliver Cromwell's seizure of the castle in 1650, the Great Hall was converted into a barracks for his troops; and in 1737 it was subdivided into three storeys to house 312 soldiers.[56] Following the construction of the New Barracks in the 1790s, it became a military hospital until 1897. It was then restored by Hippolyte Blanc in line with contemporary ideas of medieval architecture.[128] The Great Hall is still occasionally used for ceremonial occasions, and has been used as a venue on Hogmanay for BBC Scotland's Hogmanay Live programme. To the south of the hall is a section of curtain wall from the 14th century with a parapet of later date.[122]\nQueen Anne Building\nThe Queen Anne Building (centre-right)\nIn the 16th century, this area housed the kitchens serving the adjacent Great Hall, and was later the site of the Royal Gunhouse.[155] The present building was named after Queen Anne and was built during the attempted Jacobite invasion by the Old Pretender in 1708. It was designed by Captain Theodore Dury, military engineer for Scotland, who also designed Dury's Battery, named in his honour, on the south side of the castle in 1713.[156] The Queen Anne Building provided accommodation for Staff Officers, but after the departure of the Army it was remodelled in the 1920s as the Naval and Military Museum, to complement the newly opened Scottish National War Memorial.[122] The museum later moved to the former hospital in the western part of the castle, and the building now houses a function suite and an education centre.[157]\nScottish National War Memorial\nMain article: Scottish National War Memorial\nThe Scottish National War Memorial\nThe Scottish National War Memorial occupies a converted barrack block on the north side of Crown Square. It stands on the site of the medieval St. Mary's Church which was rebuilt in 1366, and was converted into an armoury in 1540. It was demolished in 1755, and the masonry reused to build a new North Barrack Block on the site.[158] Proposals for a Scottish National War Memorial were put forward in 1917, during the First World War, and the architect Sir Robert Lorimer was appointed in 1919. Construction began in 1923, and the memorial was formally opened on 14 July 1927 by the Prince of Wales.[159] The exterior is decorated with gargoyles and sculpture, while the interior contains monuments to individual regiments. The stained-glass windows are by Douglas Strachan.[160]\nThe memorial commemorates Scottish soldiers, and those serving with Scottish regiments, who died in the two world wars and in more recent conflicts. Upon the altar within the Shrine, placed upon the highest point of the Castle Rock, is a sealed casket containing Rolls of Honour which list over 147,000 names of those soldiers killed in the First World War. After the Second World War, another 50,000 names were inscribed on Rolls of Honour held within the Hall, and further names continue to be added there.[159][161] The memorial is maintained by a charitable trust.[162]\nPresent use\nPanoramic view from Edinburgh Castle, June 2024\nEdinburgh Castle is in the ownership of the Scottish Ministers as heads of the devolved Scottish Government. The castle is run and administered, for the most part, by Historic Environment Scotland, an executive agency of the Scottish Government, although the Army remains responsible for some areas, including the New Barracks block and the military museums. Both Historic Environment Scotland and the Army share use of the Guardroom immediately inside the castle entrance.[1]\nA re-enactor portraying James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, a husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, in the Great Hall\nTourist attraction\nHistoric Environment Scotland undertakes the dual tasks of operating the castle as a commercially viable tourist attraction, while simultaneously bearing responsibility for conservation of the site. Edinburgh Castle remains the most popular paid visitor attraction in Scotland, with over 2.2 million visitors in 2019.[6] Historic Environment Scotland maintains a number of facilities within the castle, including two cafés/restaurants, several shops, and numerous historical displays. An educational centre in the Queen Anne Building runs events for schools and educational groups, and employs re-enactors in costume and with period weaponry.[163]\nMilitary role\nSentries guarding the Gatehouse\nDirect administration of the castle by the War Office came to an end in 1905, and in 1923 the Army formally moved to the city's new Redford Barracks. Nevertheless, the castle continues to have a strong connection with the Army, and is one of the few ancient castles in Britain that still has a military garrison, albeit for largely ceremonial and administrative purposes. Public duties performed by the garrison include guarding the Honours of Scotland, and armed sentries stand watch at the Gatehouse outside opening hours. The post of Governor of Edinburgh Castle is now a ceremonial post. The New Barracks contain both the Governor's House, which serves as the Officers' Mess, and the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The Army retains responsibility for these and for the Royal Scots Museum and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum.[1][164]\nMilitary tattoo\nMain article: Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo\nRoyal Marines emerging from Edinburgh Castle during the military tattoo in 2005\nA series of performances known as the Edinburgh Military Tattoo (since 2010 the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo) takes place on the Esplanade each year during August. The basis of each performance is a parade of the massed pipes and drums of the Scottish regiments, and since its inception in 1950 the tattoo has developed a complex format that includes a variety of performers invited from around the world, although still with a largely military focus. The climax of the evening is the lone piper on the castle battlements, playing a pibroch in memory of dead comrades-in-arms, followed by massed bands joining in a medley of traditional Scottish tunes. The tattoo attracts an annual audience of around 217,000 people, and is broadcast in some 30 countries to a television audience estimated at 100 million.[165][166]\nOne O'Clock Gun\nThe One O'Clock Gun being fired from Mill's Mount Battery\nThe One O'Clock Gun is a time signal, fired every day at precisely one p.m., excepting Sunday, Good Friday and Christmas Day. The 'Time Gun' was established in 1861 as a time signal for ships in the harbour of Leith and the Firth of Forth, 2 miles (3 km) away. It complemented the 'Time Ball', which was installed on the Nelson Monument in 1852, but was useless as a visual signal in foggy weather. Because sound travels relatively slowly (approximately 343 metres per second (770 mph)), a map was produced in 1861 to show the actual time when the sound of the gun would be heard at various locations across Edinburgh.[167]\nThe original gun was an 18-pound muzzle-loading cannon, which needed four men to load, and was fired from the Half Moon Battery. This was replaced in 1913 by a 32-pound breech-loader, and in May 1952 by a 25-pound Howitzer.[168] The present One O'Clock Gun is an L118 Light Gun, brought into service on 30 November 2001.[169]\nOn Sunday 2 April 1916, at an unknown time of day, the One O'Clock Gun was fired in vain at a German Zeppelin during an air raid, the gun's only known use in war.[170]\nThe gun is now fired from Mill's Mount Battery, on the north face of the castle, by the District Gunner from the 105th Regiment Royal Artillery. Although the gun is no longer required for its original purpose, the ceremony has become a popular tourist attraction. The longest-serving District Gunner, Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay MBE, nicknamed \"Tam the Gun\", fired the One O'Clock Gun from 1979 until his retirement in January 2005. McKay helped establish the One O'Clock Gun Association, which opened a small exhibition at Mill's Mount, and published a book entitled What Time Does Edinburgh's One O'clock Gun Fire?[171] In 2006 Sergeant Jamie Shannon, nicknamed \"Shannon the Cannon\", became the 29th District Gunner,[172] and in 2006 Bombardier Allison Jones became the first woman to fire the gun.[173]\nSymbol of Edinburgh\nAlfred Buckham's \"Aerial View of Edinburgh\", from about 1920.\nThe castle has become a recognisable symbol of Edinburgh, and of Scotland.[174] It appears, in stylised form, on the coats of arms of the City of Edinburgh Council and the University of Edinburgh. It also features on the badge of No. 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron which was based at RAF Turnhouse (now Edinburgh Airport) during Second World War.[175] Images of the castle are used as a logo by organisations including Edinburgh Rugby, the Edinburgh Evening News, Hibernian F.C. and the Edinburgh Marathon. It also appears on the \"Castle series\" of Royal Mail postage stamps, and has been represented on various issues of banknotes issued by Scottish clearing banks. In the 1960s the castle was illustrated on £5 notes issued by the National Commercial Bank of Scotland,[176] and since 1987 it has featured on the reverse of £1 notes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland.[177] Since 2009 the castle, as part of Edinburgh's World Heritage Site, has appeared on £10 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank.[178] The castle is a focal point for annual fireworks displays which mark Edinburgh's Hogmanay (new year) celebrations,[179] and the end of the Edinburgh Festival in the summer.[180]\nSee also\nBanknotes of Scotland (featured on design)\nList of governors of Edinburgh Castle\nList of castles in Scotland\nMilitary history of Scotland\nArmed forces in Scotland\nHistory of Edinburgh\nStone of Scone\nNotes\nBibliography\nAshmole, Myrtle (1981).

    "text": "Castle in Fife, Scotland, UK\nAberdour Castle is in the village of Easter Aberdour, Fife, Scotland. Parts of the castle date from around 1200, making Aberdour one of the two oldest datable standing castles in Scotland, along with Castle Sween in Argyll, which was built at around the same time.[1]\nThe earliest part of the castle was a modest hall house, on a site overlooking the Dour Burn. Over the next 400 years, the castle was successively expanded according to contemporary architectural ideas. The hall house became a tower house in the 15th century, and was extended twice in the 16th century. The final addition was made around 1635, with refined Renaissance details, and the whole was complemented by a walled garden to the east and terraced gardens to the south. The terraces, dating from the mid-16th century, form one of the oldest gardens in Scotland,[2] and offer extensive views across the Firth of Forth to Edinburgh.\nThe castle is largely the creation of the Douglas Earls of Morton, who held Aberdour from the 14th century. The earls used Aberdour as a second home until 1642, when their primary residence, Dalkeith House, was sold. A fire in the late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased nearby Aberdour House, and the medieval castle was allowed to fall into decay. Today, only the 17th-century wing remains roofed, while the tower has mostly collapsed. Aberdour Castle is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland, and is open to the public all year.\nHistory\nOrigins\nThe barony of Aberdour was acquired in 1126, by Sir Alan de Mortimer, on his marriage to Anicea, daughter of Sir John de Vipont.[3] Sir Alan built St Fillan's Church, which still stands, next to the castle, in around 1140, and his family probably built the original hall house in around 1200,[4] or possibly even earlier.[5] In 1216, another Alan de Mortimer is recorded granting land to the monks of Inchcolm Abbey.[4] There is no record of what happened to the de Mortimers, but in the early 14th century, King Robert the Bruce granted Aberdour to his kinsman, Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray (d. 1332). Moray's grandson granted the barony in turn to Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale (c. 1300–1353), in 1342.[4]\nIn 1351, Sir William Douglas gave the lands of Aberdour to his nephew, Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith, although he retained the castle for himself until his death two years later. The grant was confirmed by King David II in 1361.[6] In 1386 Aberdour and Dalkeith were combined to form a single barony, with the principal seat at Dalkeith, near Edinburgh, and Aberdour as a secondary residence.[6] James, fourth Lord Dalkeith, succeeded to the joint barony in 1456, and was created Earl of Morton in 1458, prior to his marriage to Joanna, the deaf-mute daughter of James I.[6] The newly created earl expanded the existing hall house, heightening and rebuilding the structure to suit his elevated status.[7] The second earl carried out extensions to Aberdour Castle around 1500, building a new stair tower and south block.[3]\n16th century\nJames Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, Regent of Scotland from 1572 to 1578\nIn 1538 James V summoned the 3rd Earl of Morton before the Privy Council, accusing him of non-payment of his feudal dues,[6] and in 1540 he banished the Earl to Inverness.[8] Morton reached Brechin, in Angus, where he signed a deed resigning his lands to his kinsman Robert Douglas of Lochleven.[8] Lochleven was compelled to resign the lands in turn to James V, although he was permitted to keep Aberdour Castle. After James V's death in late 1542, George Douglas of Pittendreich and the Earl of Arran assisted Morton in reclaiming his lands, including Aberdour. In return their sons were to marry two of Morton's three daughters. Pittendreich's son James (1525–1581) married the heiress, Elizabeth, and succeeded, in 1553, as 4th Earl of Morton.[8]\nAberdour Castle was reserved to his mother-in-law, Katherine Stewart, dowager Countess of Morton, until 1564. Morton went to law in 1553 against Katherine Stewart, dowager Countess of Morton, over the lands of Aberdour. She had tried to hold a tenantry court at Aberdour, and Morton objected on the grounds that women who held lands in \"conjunct-fee\" had never held courts.[9] In 1564 Mary, Queen of Scots, confirmed Morton's right to the whole barony of Dalkeith and Aberdour.[10] In 1566, Morton was involved in planning a rebellion against the Queen, which resulted in the murder of Queen Mary's secretary, David Riccio, but failed to gain further momentum, and Morton was forced to flee to England.[11] However, by the end of the year he had returned, and by July the following year, Mary was imprisoned and had been forced to abdicate by the Scottish noblemen.[10] Morton was appointed Regent of Scotland, for the child King James VI in 1572.[10]\nMorton undertook extensions to the castle in the 1570s, rebuilding the south block of c. 1500, and extending it further south to form the present central range.[3] He also drew inspiration from contemporary gardens in England, such as Hampton Court, in laying out the terraced gardens.[7] The Privy Council met at Aberdour Castle in August 1576, but Morton's regency came to an end in 1578.[12] He was later implicated in the 1567 murder of Queen Mary's husband, Lord Darnley, and executed in 1581 on the orders of the young King.[12]\nWhile Morton was in prison, his lands were given to his nephew, Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus, but were granted to the Earl of Lennox after Morton's execution. In 1587, Lennox returned the Morton lands to Angus,[13] who was now acknowledged as the 5th Earl of Morton. On Angus' death, in 1588, the earldom of Morton passed to another kinsman, William Douglas of Lochleven (d. 1606). William's son predeceased his father, but his widow, Jean Lyon, continued to live at Aberdour with her third husband, Lord Spynie.[13] James VI and Anne of Denmark stayed for five days with Lord Spynie in December 1590.[14] Colonel William Stewart and Sir James Sandilands accused Spynie of entertaining the rebel Earl of Bothwell at Aberdour in 1592 but he denied this.[15]\nThe 17th century wing of the castle, showing the sundial\nThe later Earls\nWilliam Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton (1582–1648), sometimes numbered as the 6th Earl, inherited Aberdour from his grandfather in 1606. He was Treasurer of Scotland from 1630 to 1636, and a strong supporter of the Stewart dynasty during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639–1651). However, he was compelled to spend much of his fortune in the royal interest, leading him into financial difficulty, and forcing him to sell Dalkeith to the Earl of Buccleuch in 1642.[13] Earl William built the Renaissance east wing at Aberdour, probably around 1635.[3] It was certainly standing in 1647, when an inventory records luxurious furniture, carpets, and tapestries.[7] The walled garden was also built in the 1630s, and improvements made to the terraces.[7] Aberdour was therefore a suitable principal residence for the Earls after the sale of Dalkeith.\nThe Earls of Morton continued to live at Aberdour, although they never regained their earlier high status. In 1688 the castle was badly damaged by fire, and in 1690 the 11th Earl consulted the architect James Smith. Smith surveyed the damage and drew up proposals for repairing and extending the castle with another wing north of the east range.[16] The Earl also sought estimates for the demolition of the tower house and central range.[16] Nothing ever came of these proposals, although repairs were carried out to the east range, being completed in 1703.[16]\nFinal decline\nAberdour Castle ruins, 2010\nGovernment troops were stationed at Aberdour Castle during the Jacobite Rising of 1715. During their stay, a second fire again caused extensive damage. In 1725, the Mortons bought an adjacent property, Cuttlehill House, which they renamed Aberdour House, and the castle ceased to be a residence.[16] The east range was again repaired, and was used for various purposes, including a school room, a barracks, and a masonic hall.[16] In 1924 the castle and gardens were placed in state care, and continue to be managed by Historic Environment Scotland as a visitor attraction. The south-east wing was initially restored as a home for the custodian, and now houses a cafe. The castle is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument,[17] and the grounds, and surrounding former parks, are listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national register of significant gardens.[2]\nDescription\nGround-floor plan of the castle\nThe castle originally comprised the 12th- or 13th-century hall house, which was extended in the 15th century. In the 16th century the central range was built to the south of the tower house, and new inner and outer courtyard walls were constructed.[3] The east part of the inner courtyard wall is reduced to foundations, but the base of a round tower and a porter's lodge survive.[18] To the west, the inner courtyard wall remains, enclosing the former service courtyard, which comprises a brewery and bakehouse, with ovens.[19] The east range was added in the 17th century, along the south edge of the outer courtyard. The castle was originally approached from the north, with the entrance moved to the west, along with the 17th-century gate, when the Aberdour railway line was constructed in 1890.[3]\nThe tower house\nThe tower house measures 16 metres (52 ft) by 11 metres (36 ft) on a skewed rectangular plan.[20] The lower two storeys comprise the oldest part of the castle, which can be dated to around 1200, while the upper parts are of the 15th century. The date for the original building is based on several pieces of evidence. The cubical blocks of masonry, the flat buttress at the northeast, and the splaying, or widening, of the base of the walls, are all indicative of this date.[21] The collapsed part of the south wall also formerly contained an early 13th-century style double-lancet window.[3] The original structure, of a type known as a hall house, was probably of two or three storeys, comprising a first-floor hall over an unvaulted basement, and may have been surrounded by a defensive timber stockade or enclosure.[20]\nThe 15th-century rebuilding added two upper floors, and rearranged the interior. Vaulted basements, including a kitchen, and a spiral stair were inserted, and the heightened wall was topped by a parapet with machicolations; spaces through which objects could be dropped on attackers at the base of the wall.[3] The tower suffered major collapses in 1844 and 1919, and today just the basement survives, with only a small section of the southeast wall standing to its full height.[3]\nThe ruins of the tower house on the left, showing fallen masonry, with the central range behind\nThe central range\nThe central range was begun around 1500, possibly as a two-storey building containing a great hall, although only fragments of this building remain.[19] The south entrance to the tower house was blocked up, and replaced with a ground floor entrance from the east. A new stair tower, with a broad spiral stair, was built at the southeast corner. Originally topped by a conical roof, this stair gave access to the upper floors in the tower, and to the central range.[3] Around 1570, the 4th Earl of Morton rebuilt the block, extending it further south to form new apartments. This block, forming the present three-storey central range, includes a vaulted kitchen and cellar in the basement, with suites of rooms above.\nThe two bedrooms on the first floor each have their own closets and garderobes, or privies. The west apartment is accessed from the terraced garden, via another stair to the south-west, and has a private stair which led up to another chamber above, suggesting that these were the Earl and Countesses apartments.[3] The upper storey, whose timber floor is now missing, comprised three more apartments, including one over the stair. The exterior of the block is decorated with a horizontal decorative strip of masonry known as a string course. One first-floor window is decorated with carved stone pilasters and strapwork,[3] in a similar style to windows at Edinburgh Castle and Drochil Castle, in the Borders, both of which were built under Morton's Regency.[22]\nThe east range\nPainted ceiling in the east range\nThe east range, of c.1635, comprises a long, narrow building, with a short projecting wing to the southeast. It is the only part of the castle still roofed. The first floor of the wing is occupied by a long gallery, accessed from the central range, with stables and storerooms below. The long gallery was used for entertaining, and, in 1647, is recorded as containing 46 pictures and a harpsichord, among other furniture.[23] In the southeast wing are three chambers, one on each floor, linked by a spiral stair. The first-floor room has a 17th-century painted ceiling, decorated with fruit, foliage, and heraldic emblems.[3] The south-east wing has crow-step gables, and a sundial on one corner. The east window of the long gallery is decorated with pilasters and a pediment. The roof is of 18th-century date, and is lower than the original, resulting in the loss of the triangular pediments which once topped each of the side windows.[3]\nThe terraced garden, with the doocot on the right, and St Fillan's Church on the left\nThe gardens\nThere were gardens at Aberdour Castle from at least 1540.[24] The terraced garden dates from the time of the 4th Earl of Morton, who succeeded in 1553, and comprises four broad L-shaped terraces. At the bottom of the terraces was an orchard, laid out in 1690, and recently replanted.[24] The extent of the terracing was only rediscovered following excavations in the 1970s, after parts of the garden had been in use as a market garden.[2]\nArchaeological investigations were undertaken between 1977 and 1980, to determine whether the lower terraces, which were depicted on a map of 1740, had indeed existed. Although the foundations of the terraces were found, the remains could not be precisely dated, but are thought to have been constructed in the second half of the 16th century.[25] The high retaining walls were rebuilt in 1981,[3] and the terraces were laid with grass, since the excavations had not revealed any evidence of historic planting schemes.[25]\nAberdour Castle doocot\nA 16th-century \"beehive\" shape doocot, or pigeon house, is located to the south, containing around 600 nesting boxes. The 9 metres (30 ft) structure rises in four steps, divided by \"rat courses\"; projecting ribs which prevented rats from climbing inside.[26]\nThe 17th-century walled garden covers around 5,000 square metres (1.2 acres), with walls up to 4 metres (13 ft) high. It lies to the west of the outer courtyard, and was originally entered from doors in the southwest and northeast corners. These doors have carved pediments, with strapwork and the Douglas heart emblem over the west door, which led to the terraces. The east door led to St. Fillan's Church, and is carved with the date 1632, together with a monogram of the initials of the Earl and Countess.[24] A kitchen garden was located across the Kirk Lane, and bee boles are located in the walls. A summer house was built into the south-east garden wall in 1675, but was demolished in the 18th century.[2]\nIn 1691, botanist James Sutherland supplied exotic plants, including Persian jasmine, tamarisks and figs, to Aberdour from the Physic Garden in Edinburgh, the forerunner of the Royal Botanic Garden.[24] The later entrance in the west wall dates from around 1740. During the Second World War, the garden was in use as a market garden and for pig rearing.[27] In the centre of the garden, an early 17th-century polygonal sundial is mounted on a 19th-century base.[3] The sundial was brought here before 1887,[28] possibly from Castle Wigg in southwest Scotland.[27]\nAberdour House\nOriginally named Cuttlehill, the house was built in the 17th century, and is dated 1672.[29] It was enlarged in 1715 by its then owner, the Earl of Moray. The Earl of Morton purchased it in 1725, finally moving out of the dilapidated castle. In 1731 the 12th Earl consulted James Gibbs on improvements. It is uncertain how much of Gibbs' proposals were executed, although the doorway has a surround in Gibbs' style.[3] By the 20th century the house was disused, and was redeveloped as private flats in the 1990s. The house is Category A listed,[29] and formerly had its own extensive gardens, which included the surviving 12-metre (39 ft) high obelisk of 1744–45, built by the 13th Earl to be visible from his estate at Dalmahoy, across the Firth of Forth.[30]\nReferences\nBibliography\nApted, Michael (1996) Aberdour Castle.

    "text": "Castle in Fife, Scotland\nFalkland Palace, 'East Quarter' from the Courtyard\nFalkland Palace, 'South Quarter' from the Courtyard\nFalkland Palace, in Falkland, Fife, Scotland, is a royal palace of the Scottish kings. It was one of the favourite places of Mary, Queen of Scots, who took refuge there from political and religious turmoil of her times.\nToday it is under the stewardship of Ninian Stuart, who delegates most of his duties to the National Trust for Scotland. The Chapel Royal in the Palace is dedicated to Thomas the Apostle.[1] It is open to the public and reserved for Catholic worship.[2]\nHistory\nEarly years\nFalkland Palace from the gardens\nReal tennis court\nIn the late 12th century, a royal hunting lodge was located on this site. The lodge was expanded in the 13th century to operate as a castle, owned by the Earls of Fife of the noted Clan MacDuff. The castle was built here because the site is on a slight hill that could be defended. The surrounding land eventually were developed as the Palace gardens.\nTo the north, between the royal stable and the River Eden, was a great oak wood. Its many groves merged into the surrounding parkland. Timber was occasionally cut in the forest for royal ships of war.\nThe castle would have been surrounded by meadows, fields, orchards, glades and Falkland Park, which was a managed forest surrounded by a pale, a ditch with a fence on top of it. The pale would have been used to keep game inside the park reserved for hunting by the royal family and its courtiers. A park keeper maintained the Pale. In 1469 the keeper Bannatyne was docked wages for failing to keep it repaired.[3]\nIn 1371 Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Fife acknowledged Robert Stewart, Earl of Menteith, son of Robert II, as her heir. She made him keeper of the castle and forest of Falkland. In 1402 Stewart, by then Duke of Albany, imprisoned his nephew and rival David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, at Falkland; he was the eldest son of Robert III. The incarcerated Duke eventually died from neglect and starvation.[4]\nAlbany was exonerated from blame by the Parliament of Scotland, but suspicions of foul play persisted. These suspicions were carried against Rothesay's younger brother, the future King James I. These events eventually led to the downfall of the Albany Stewarts.\nAfter ordering the execution of Albany's son Murdoch in 1424, James I took possession of Falkland for the crown.[5] Falkland became a popular retreat with all the Stewart monarchs and queens consort. They practised falconry there and used the vast surrounding forests for hawking. Red deer and fallow deer were kept in the park for hunting, some brought from the Torwood Forest near Stirling.[6]\nMary of Guelders\nJames II of Scotland granted Falkland to his queen consort Mary of Guelders, and the palace or castle became a favourite residence.[7] The stables and other buildings in the close were repaired and a new kitchen was built for the visits of the royal couple in 1453. Linseed, cabbage seed, onion, leek, and other seeds were bought for the garden.[8]\nAs a widow, Mary of Guelders employed her stewards Henry Kinghorn and William Blair to supervise improvements at Falkland Palace in 1461–2. The works included a stairway from the queen's chamber to the pleasance, new stables, a coal shed, repairs and an extension to the counting house, and a smith-made andirons or firedogs for the queen's bedchamber and the fire grate of the great hall. The royal carpenter was Andrew Lesouris.[9] New structures included a \"galry\" with two chambers, apparently the earliest use of the French-derived term \"gallery\" in Britain.[10]\nWorks in the grounds included the construction of two ponds in the hay yard. A new lawn was laid near the queen's chamber, and a doorway was made for her to access the garden.[11] Such access was popular in this period; in other countries, Margaret of Anjou at Greenwich Palace and Isabella of Portugal at Bruges had access from their lodgings to the gardens.[12] Eleanor of Naples built new lodgings and a terrace garden at Castello Estense in Ferrara.[13]\nAt Linlithgow Palace, a door leads out to the garden and pele at the foot of what may have been the queen consort's tower under the oriel windows of the royal chambers.[14] Mary of Guelders is said to have had a garden walk made between two oak trees, known as \"Queen's Quarrels\", a name suggestive of the practice of archery, a \"quarrel\" being a name for a crossbow bolt. Another walk was called the \"Gilderland\".[15] The hay meadow of Falkland is regularly mentioned in the royal accounts, as are onions, because the palace gardener's pay was based on four barrels of onions.[16]\nJames III and Margaret of Denmark came to Falkland in September 1473.[17] The court of the Exchequer met at Falkland annually to complete the accounts of the jointure lands of James's mother, Mary of Guelders.[18] She may have intended to make Falkland Palace her residence and spiritual retreat in widowhood.[19]\nJames IV at Falkland\nBetween 1497 and 1541 James IV and James V transformed the old castle and royal lodgings into a beautiful renaissance-style royal palace. James enjoyed imported oranges at Falkland in April 1497 and gave a tip to the gardener and workmen building the dyke around the park.[20] In May 1501 James IV hired two stonemasons from Dundee to work at the palace, and an hourglass was bought for time-keeping. On 13 December 1501 he was entertained at Falkland by the female minstrel Quhissilgibboun, and in September 1504 by fiddlers, lutenists, and an African drummer known as the \"More taubronar\". A man from Pittenweem brought a live seal to the castle on 25 September 1502 and James IV gave him 14 shillings in reward.[21]\nA new chapel (perhaps on the site of the present south quarter) was roofed in 1512 by Alexander and John Slater, and masons worked on the garden wall. William Thome completed the walls of the great hall.[22] James IV was entertained at Falkland by the \"Wild Lady\", who received £10 for her appearances in 1513.[23]\nJames IV brought deer-nets from Kinneil House in November 1503. Andrew Matheson built a fold for deer in November 1505.[24] A trap was made to \"slay foxes in the park of Falkland\".[25] For a time in 1507 the horse of the French herald Montjoie, Gilbert Chauveau, was kept in the palace stables.[26] In May 1508 James IV and John Methven stalked deer in the park with a firearm called a culverin.[27] Later, wild boar, imported from France, were kept in the Park, within a fence made by the Laird of Fernie.[28] Dairy and beef cattle were kept to support the castle population.\nJames V and Mary of Guise\nThe teenage James V was detained at Falkland Palace by the Earl of Angus and, according to Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, escaped to Stirling Castle which was held by his mother Margaret Tudor. He had announced an early morning deer hunt in the park, but escaped by horse in the middle of the night dressed as a stable hand.[29]\nTo address the poor state of the garden and park, James V appointed a new Captain and Keeper, William Barclay, Master of Rhynd, in March 1527.[30] The Queen's Chamber was hung with tapestry for Margaret Tudor in September 1534.[31] James V extended his father's buildings in French renaissance style from 1537. He arranged to build a Royal Tennis Court and bowling alley in the garden in 1541.[32] The tennis court was called a caichpule in Scots and the game was known in French as jeu de paume.[33] Mary was said to have scandalised the people of Scotland by wearing men's breeches to play the game. The arms of the King of Scots at the gatehouse\nAmidst the building works and renovations, the Scotland court regularly went to Falkland, and in December 1538 and 1540 new velvet and satin gowns were packed in a canvas bag and sent to Falkland as gifts for the Queen's ladies in waiting.[34] In February 1539 one of Mary of Guise's French courtiers, Marie Pieris, married Lord Seton by handfasting. The French apothecary was also at Falkland on that day.[35] James V held a tournament at Falkland on or around May Day 1539.[36]\nMary of Guise spent time embroidering her husband's shirts at Falkland with gold thread in October 1539, and the luggage of her ladies in waiting included embroidery equipment, called \"broder warklumys\".[37] James V played cards with Mary of Guise during their visit in April 1540. While they were at the palace, servants washed the clothes of his infant daughter by Elizabeth Beaton, the Lady Jean Stewart.[38] Thomas Melville's wife kept the royal family's pets. In August Mary of Guise went riding at Falkland in a new cloak of scarlet cloth edged with crimson velvet.[39]\nThe goldsmith John Mosman made a gilt chalice for the couple's short-lived son Prince James, born 1540. In July 1541 they sent the chalice to Falkland to be used in the palace chapel. In the same month wild boar from France arrived. The Laird of Fernie built a new park dyke and a timber-fenced run for the boar.[40][41] The wild boar came from Elbeuf near Rouen, and Mary of Guise's younger brother René II de Lorraine, Marquis d'Elbeuf later became an enthusiast for the boar hunt with dogs and toiles, known as le vautrait.[42] James V kept a kind of menagerie at Falkland, employing Thomas Melville's wife to look after the pets.[43]\nAn inventory recorded a green velvet bed in the wardrobe at Falkland Palace with velvet covered posts, packed in coffers and travel bags called \"sowmes\".[44] Robert Murray, the plumber who maintained the fountain at Linlithgow Palace, provided lead work for a long vanished fountain at Falkland.[45]\nJames V died at Falkland Palace in December 1542, from an illness induced by the shock and grief of his army's defeat at Solway Moss. Some say he also grieved his wife's failure to give him a male heir, when she instead gave birth to the future Mary, Queen of Scots. His body lay in the Chapel Royal for almost a month and the chapel was draped in black. On 4 January 1543 messengers ordered the gentlemen of Fife to convey the king's body to North Queensferry on its way to Holyrood Abbey.[46]\nReign of Mary, Queen of Scots\nMary of Guise, mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, frequently stayed at Falkland.\nMary, Queen of Scots was born at Linlithgow Palace and moved to Stirling Castle in July 1543. Her mother, Mary of Guise, sometimes travelled without her to stay at Falkland Palace. Falkland and Stirling palaces were official residences of Mary of Guise as a widow, and she continued to keep wild boars for hunting in Falkland park.[47] Mary of Guise frequently stayed at Falkland, especially in autumn, and was recorded there in October 1546,[48] and in September 1549.[49] A letter, perhaps of 1548, mentions the refurbishment of the stables, the wardrobes, and the lodgings of one of her officials.[50]\nMary of Guise asked the Earl of Bothwell to escort her from Falkland to Stirling Castle for a convention or council in December 1549.[51] In October 1552, Regent Arran (who ruled Scotland on behalf of Mary) wondered if Mary of Guise would come from Falkland for a Privy Council meeting because the palace and town were too small for the number of expected attendees. He wrote, \"they will be a great company of folks and can not be easily lodged in Falkland\".[52] Regent Arran's daughter, Anne Hamilton, joined Mary of Guise at Falkland in June 1553.[53]\nNearby Myres Castle was the home of the Royal Macers and Sergeants at Arms who served Falkland Castle since at least the 16th century. John Scrimgeour of Myres supervised building at the Palace from 1532 to 1563.[54] He wrote to Mary of Guise about repairs to Falkland and its lead roofs, delayed by the frosts, and the carts he needed to bring stones to the palace and timber from the harbour at Levenmouth.[55] In May 1559 Scrimgeour repaired the stables and hired Adam Symmers to fix the palace windows. He also designed new ditches and fences for the garden.[56]\nMary, Queen of Scots, returned from France in September 1561, and hosted a group of diplomats at Falkland.[57] She held her Maundy Thursday or \"Skyris Thurisday\" ceremony at Falkland in March 1562, washing the feet of 19 young women. John Balfour bought new linen cloth for the aprons and towels which she gave to the maidens. The number of young women matched her age.[58] Mary came for Easter at Falkland in April 1563 and 1564.[59] The queen's many visits to Falkland have been tracked in archival sources.[60]\nJames VI and Anne of Denmark\nJames VI of Scotland was considered an adult ruler after October 1579. In preparation for his visits to Falkland, a cooper in Leith, William Todd, supplied barrels and brewing equipment for the palace.[61] In April 1582, James VI of Scotland made John Killoch and Robert Schaw keepers of all his tennis courts, and suppliers of his balls and rackets. In June 1583, Schaw spent £100 on refurbishing the court at Falkland.[62]\nJames VI spent the summer of 1583 at Falkland, and the English diplomat Robert Bowes noted it was a \"little house\" unsuitable for holding a parliament.[63] In 1584 James VI had the roofs repaired, and requested Agnes Leslie, Lady of Lochleven, and his tenants in Fife to send horses and help carry slates, tiles, timber, sand and lime to the palace. In July and August 1584, James welcomed Albert Fontenay, a French envoy sent by his mother, at Falkland, and lent him a horse to join in the hunting.[64]\nJames stayed in the palace during the plague in July 1585. For fear of infection, he ordered people with no business in Falkland or at court to stay away.[65] His guests in Fife in the summer of 1585 included the English ambassador Edward Wotton and three Danish envoys who came to discuss the Orkney and Shetland islands and the king's marriage.[66]\nIn August 1586, James VI was at Falkland with the French diplomat Charles de Prunelé, Baron d'Esneval.[67] In September he received a gift of books and hunting horses from Elizabeth I, and news of the discovery of the Babington Plot.[68] The Master of Gray wrote from Falkland to the Scottish ambassador in London that James was \"content for the law to go forward\", if her life was safe.[69]\nJames VI held a meeting at Falkland in September 1587 to discuss his marriage plans after hearing from his ambassadors that the elder Danish Princess Elizabeth was promised to another.[70]\nJames VI married the younger Princess Anne of Denmark; he included Falkland in the \"morning gift\" that he gave to his bride. On 12 May 1590 the Danish ambassadors rode from Wemyss Castle to Falkland to evaluate the palace and her Fife lands. They were welcomed by the keeper James Beaton of Creich.[71] The lawyer John Skene produced a charter of the queen's lands and, as a traditional symbol of ownership, the Danish Admiral Peder Munk was given a handful of earth and stone. After this ceremony, they rode to the Newhouse of Lochleven Castle.[72]\nThe following year, another Danish ambassador Paul Knibbe came to Falkland in July 1591. He brought a Danish gentlewoman, probably Margaret Vinstarr, to join the Queen's household.[73] Around this time an African servant of Anne of Denmark, known only as \"the Moir\" [Moor],[74][75] died and was buried at Falkland,[76] probably at the kirkyard of Kilgour. He was identified as a \"page of the equerry\" who wore clothes of orange velvet and Spanish taffeta.[77]\nRaid of Falkland\nFor five hours in the morning of 28 June 1592 Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, with the Master of Gray, James Lumsden of Airdrie, the Laird of Niddrie, John Colville, and Spott with others including men from Cumbria attempted to capture the palace and James VI and Anne of Denmark. James VI had been warned of Bothwell's approach and had stayed at Falkland rather than go to Perth as he had planned. Bothwell's plans had been revealed to the English ambassador in Edinburgh, Robert Bowes, and he had told Richard Cockburn, the Earl of Morton, and the Master of Glamis that the king should \"look narrowly about him\". Bothwell crossed the Forth at Queensferry on 27 June with 400 men.[78] The Earl of Erroll and Colonel William Houston were at Falkland and they were arrested on suspicion of being inside-men.[79]\nBothwell's men attempted to batter down the back gate but were repulsed by gunshots before midnight on 27 June.[80] The king withdrew to the gatehouse tower and his guard shot at Bothwell's men. According to James Melville the defenders who favoured Bothwell loaded their guns with paper rather than bullets. Bothwell abandoned the attack at 7 o'clock in the morning, and rode away with the king's horses.[81] James Sandilands gave chase. He captured nine men whose horses tired, five were hanged in Edinburgh's Canongate, the others were ransomed. One of John Colville's servants was hanged, a packet of coded letters and a cipher was found in his possession.[82]\nThe English border reiver Richie Graham of Brackenhill and his companions sacked the town of Falkland, taking horses, clothing, and money.[83] It was said that Bothwell had given a pep talk to his supporters, encouraging them to kill Sir John Carmichael, Sir George Home, and Roger Aston.[84]\nA month later it was said that Bothwell was advancing towards Falkland again from Stirling Bridge, and some of his men had landed in boats at a creek near Aberdour Castle. The king was forewarned by Harry Lindsay and prepared for another fight. The Earl of Argyll rode from his wedding party at Dalkeith Palace to help the king. Men in arms were summoned from Edinburgh, Haddington and Linlithgow to fight the rebel earl. However, Robert Bowes was told it was a deliberate false alarm, possibly intended to make the king move from Falkland to a less secure location. Bothwell also attempted to corner the King in Holyroodhouse.[85]\nPalace staff in the 1590s\nThe royal couple returned to Falkland in 1593, enjoying five tuns of wine which were shipped to nearby Levenmouth. At this time, James Beaton of Creich was keeper of the palace.[86] Robert Arnot of Kilquhus, Chamberlain of Fife, looked after the park and the meadow, and took receipt of local produce including the onions from the palace garden. Andrew Fairny maintained the dykes and ditches. The tenants of the village of Casch were compensated for damage done by escaped deer. James VI's master stabler David Murray kept the king's mares and stags in the park. Guilliam looked after the hay, and George Strathauchin was the palace gardener.[87]\nDeer from England\nQueen Elizabeth I sent deer for the park in 1586 and 1587, and again in 1591 from parks near Colchester. These were diplomatic gifts. In May 1586, James VI went to Falkland the deer taken out of carts and set loose in the park.[88] James asked the English ambassador Thomas Randolph for some of Elizabeth's huntsmen, Yeoman prickers and Grooms of the leash, and some horses.[89] A Yeoman pricker was employed to manage and guide the hunted deer.[90]\nEnglish huntsmen and bucks were sent to James VI in August 1586 by Randolph and the Scottish ambassador in London, Archibald Douglas.[91] Randolph wrote:I have sent the Kynge two hunting men, verie good and skillful, with one footman, that can hoop, hollow and crye, that all the trees in Fawkland will quake for fear. Pray the Kynge's Majestie to be mercifull to the poor bucks; but let him spare and look well to himself.[92]\nIn November 1586, Archibald Douglas wrote to Francis Walsingham that a gift of bucks from Elizabeth might help James with his grief at the forthcoming loss of his mother.[93] In May 1592 the English ambassador Robert Bowes went to Barnard Castle, Raby Castle and Brancepeth Castle with the English-born royal huntsman Cuthbert Rayne to catch deer for James VI and managed to catch only six, which he shipped from Sunderland to Kirkcaldy.[94] In April 1597, the carpenter and \"master wright\" James Murray was in charge of transporting 28 English deer from Leith to Falkland. Robin the Hunter kept hounds for James at Falkland. Anne of Denmark sent deer hounds as gifts to her brother, Christian IV of Denmark.[95]\nA royal quarrel\nJames VI and Anne of Denmark spent time at Falkland during their quarrel about Prince Henry\nAnother Danish commission including Steen Bille and Niels Krag visited in 1593, which resulted in the keeper James Beaton of Creich giving more rights over the lands and buildings to the queen, Anne of Denmark.[96] She came to stay on 12 July 1594 before the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle. It was said she left Edinburgh for Falkland because Holyrood Palace was not magnificent enough to receive the Danish ambassadors Steen Bille and Christian Barnekow.[97]\nJames VI arranged for Prince Henry to stay at Stirling Castle with the Earl of Mar. This did not suit the queen. Courtiers took sides as the quarrel deepened. In August 1595 James persuaded Anne, who was now reluctant to leave Edinburgh, to come to Falkland and meet the Earl of Mar for a reconciliation. The kirk minister and royal chaplain Patrick Galloway gave a sermon about Adam and Eve and the duties of man and wife to each other, and it was thought that \"she gave good ear to his advice\". Another church minister David Lindsay, had a \"long conference\" with Anne at Falkland, hoping to heal the quarrel. It was said that James were Anne were now \"being so lovingly together at Falkland\".[98]\nAnne was joined at Falkland by her friend and servant Margaret Vinstarr. She had returned from visiting the queen's mother, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, whose message to her daughter was that she ought to obey her husband's will in all things.[99]\nThe witch-hunt of 1597\nOn 12 August 1597, James VI and his Privy Council gathered at Falkland Palace during the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597 to issue a general proclamation revoking some of the commissions of justiciary against suspected witches.[100] The proclamation came after the contentious commissions based on the evidence of accused witch, Margaret Aitken, who claimed she could detect other witches just by looking at their eyes.[101] With this proclamation, the Order of Council restored duties to James VI which had been delegated as general commissions in 1591, giving local landowners the power to execute accused witches without dispute from central government.[102]\nBy restoring these powers to the King, the Privy Council hoped to reduce the number of 'innocent' people killed.[102] However, the order was quite limited in reality, only discrediting commissions presided over by one or two men alone, and it also reiterated James VI's determination to continue with the witch-hunt.[103] However, during the trials of the early seventeenth century, the proclamation at Falkland Palace did help to introduce a new regime of restricted witch-hunting, and it demonstrated greater considerations surrounding the evidence needed to condemn a witch.[100][103]\nLast years as a royal palace\nWhen Anne of Denmark visited in September 1598 her bed chamber was hung with tapestry brought from Holyroodhouse. Rhenish, \"Rence\", wine was brought to Falkland for her.[104] A French ambassador Philippe de Béthune, brother of the Duke of Sully, came in July 1599. The English diplomat Sir William Bowes was reluctant to come to Falkland, where James VI might show more favour to the French ambassador. Béthune fell ill, needing a surgeon and a physician to bleed him. It was rumoured he had been poisoned. He recovered and went on a progress with the king to Inchmurrin and Hamilton Palace, after James VI wrote to the Laird of Wemyss for the loan of his best hackney horse and saddle.[105]\nIn July 1600 herons nested in the park, and James VI hoping to have them \"increase and multiply\" forbade anyone to kill herons in neighbouring lands.[106] In August a French acrobat danced on a tightrope in the palace courtyard for the king and the queen.[107]\nJames VI played cards with the English diplomat George Nicholson at Falkland in May 1602.[108] In September 1602 Anne of Denmark and the Master of Gray entertained Anne de Gondi, the wife of French ambassador the Baron de Tour, at Falkland, while he went on a progress with the king.[109] Lord Henry Howard noted that the Master of Gray had spent this time with Queen Anne and it affected the conceit of his writing style.[110]\nDavid Murray became keeper of the garden, park, and Lomond Hills and was allowed to build a house on the site of the old castle, called the Castlestead or Nether Palace of Falkland. Lord Walden stayed for a night in August 1613.[111] This house was inherited by the next keeper of the park, John Murray, 1st Earl of Annandale.[112] The palace was occasionally used as a prison.[113] In November 1608 James instructed David Murray to keep James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino, prisoner in the tower of the palace, for treasonable correspondence with the Pope. Balmerino was released in October 1609.[114] After hearing Anne of Denmark speak of her love of Scotland, the Venetian ambassador Antonio Foscarini came to Falkland in September 1613.[115]\nUnion of the Crowns\nAfter the Union of the Crowns in 1603, Andrew Murray of Balvaird kept a watchful eye on the palace and in 1615 he advised John Murray of the bedchamber that the king should send a commission for repairs, because otherwise \"it will not fail to fall all to the ground. The back galleries are already decayed\".[116] The architect James Murray repaired the palace for the visit of King James in 1617.[117] Some courtiers were lodged in the house of Nicol Moncrieff, which still stands in Falkland, opposite the palace gate.[118] At the celebrations to welcome the king on 19 May, David Wedderburn provided a Latin poem, in which the King, after a day of hunting, was asked to contemplate the memorials of Scotland's past, victories over the Romans and Vikings, the wars of Scottish Independence, and the present union of the kingdoms of Britain.[119]\nThe palace was repaired in 1629. Roofing slates were shipped from Dundee to Newburgh. A glazier, David Masterton, painted the iron window grills or yetts with red lead. A new set of wooden armorial panels were made for the gatehouse and painted by Valentine Jenkin.[120]\nCivil war\nCharles I, and Charles II also visited Falkland. Accounts survive for Charles II's stay in July 1650, when proclamations had to be made to reduce the inflated prices of lodgings and horse-hire charged in the village. Charles' food was seasoned with saffron, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Every tart provided for the king's table had a pound of sugar, while tarts for lesser courtiers required only half a pound.[121] The mining entrepreneur James Hope of Hopetoun visited on 18 July and met the king's physician Dr Fraser, and various officials. In the privy chamber, Charles thanked him for a previous gift of a piece of Scottish gold, and later they talked about mining and technology.[122]\nA fire partially destroyed the palace during its subsequent occupation by Oliver Cromwell's troops, and it quickly fell into ruin.\n19th century\nArms of the Marquess of Bute\nIn 1887 John, 3rd Marquis of Bute, purchased the estates of Falkland and started a 20-year restoration of the palace using two architects: John Kinross and Robert Weir Schultz. At the time the Palace was a ruin with no windows or doors. Thanks to his restoration work and considerable budget the Palace remains standing today. Many features in and around the Palace show evidence of his work, such as the \"B\" on the guttering and portraits of his children carved into a cupboard door in the Keeper's Dressing Room.\nDuring the time of Lord Bute, the ornamental kitchen garden was enhanced by a pergola and decorative vases. The north part of the \"upper garden\" was redesigned to express the foundations of Falkland Castle and Palace North Range which were uncovered during the Marquis's archaeological excavations. Walls were built atop the foundations for the Well Tower and the Great Hall to emphasise the structures.\nThe Orchard and Palace gardens were linked to the House of Falkland by the private walk and new bridges. Houses were built near the palace and connected into the ornamental kitchen garden and orchard by a system of new public and private paths. The ground around the curling pond (to the North East of the orchard) was planted with trees and shrubs and laid out in flower plots.\nThe enclosing yew hedge around the pond garden is a typical feature of period. The lime tree avenue which is north of the palace gatehouse was built sometime between 1894 and 1912–13 according to the Ordinance Surveys of those periods. The Victorian glass house was built in 1890 by Mckenzie and Moncur from Edinburgh for Lord Bute and was used mainly to grow flowers and exotic plants. Plant hunting was popular at that time and wealthy people would travel the world to find specimens, and plant in their gardens for display to friends. There is also evidence that there was a second glass house in the garden near the existing one.\nModern era\nA 1902 view of the palace\nIn 1952, the Hereditary Keeper Major Michael Crichton Stewart decided to appoint the National Trust for Scotland to take care of the Palace. The National Trust thus became Deputy Keeper of the Palace, and they now care for and maintain the Palace and its extensive gardens. The NTS website offers an array of articles and images exploring the Palace and grounds.[123]\nNational Galleries Scotland have created a digital project exploring how the palace would look if reimagined in a warmer setting due to climate change.[124]\nGardens\nFalkland Palace stands on three hectares of ground on a sandstone ridge which is dominated by the Lomond Hills in the background. Those walking around the garden will see a distinct and overlapping timeline which reveals the ever-changing purpose and style of the grounds.\nThe first record of a garden here was in 1451. In 1500, a new gardener, John Strathachin or Strachen, was to be paid 4 merks yearly with grazing for his horse and cows. He was to provide fruit, onions and herbs.[125] At that time the garden had a courtyard and stables in the gatehouse, where King James IV kept his great Belgian steed. There was also a fish pond which provided the King with fresh fish. Fruit, vegetables and herbs were grown in the area for the royal plate and meat could be hunted in the ancient forest (known as Falkland Forest) surrounding the Palace, by hawking and hunting wild boar and deer.\nJames VI met the English ambassadors Sir Robert Bowes and Sir William Bowes in the garden at 8 o'clock on 21 June 1597 and listened to their speeches about border affairs.[126] In August 1602 James VI received the French ambassador, the Baron de Tour, in the garden. They talked for three quarters of an hour and the ambassador made the king laugh. A few days later they hunted together in the park.[127]\nGarden designer Percy Cane redesigned the gardens in the 1940s. He had designed the palace grounds at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Cane was born and educated in Essex where he studied horticulture and architecture. In 1930 Cane founded and edited the quarterly journal Garden Design and wrote many books on garden design. Cane's style can best be described as Arts and Crafts and his curvy borders were seen as innovatory at the time.\nConservation in the garden is achieved through general maintenance, which includes clearing leaves, mowing the main lawn, tidying the flower beds and planting, enhancing and creating wildlife habitats. A wildflower meadow, native hedges and spring flowering bulbs have been planted to provide food and protection to various small insects and small mammals. Conservation means work has to be carried out in a sympathetic way throughout property, not only to the aesthetics and history of the palace but also for the climbing plants and bats that live in the cellars. Bats are endangered and protected in Scotland and it is important that they are not disturbed. The walls of the palace have been repointed (replacing the cement between the stones) and replaced with lime mortar which is a traditional material and better suited for this purpose as it is breathable and prevents dampening.\nThe current Head Gardener Sonia Ferrás Mañá is restoring the Percy Cane garden to the original design and flower choice. Mañá, the garden staff and volunteers have been working on various project in recent years to conserve the garden and encourage wildlife.\nThe garden team at Falkland Palace are now encouraging wildlife by bringing back the meadow. To create the meadow the grass has been cut only once a year for the last four years and more than 10,000 wild flowers and a similar number of spring flowering bulbs have been planted. This work is thanks to the garden staff, volunteers and support from Fife Environmental Trust, Scottish Natural Heritage, NTS Member Centres and other donations. These flowers and un-mown grasses encourage beneficial insects to the orchard which aid in the fruit trees pollination and in turn attract other animals. There are currently forty different fly species in the orchard, some of which are rare or unusual and some are found nowhere else in Scotland. The insects, especially the moths, have attracted Pipistrelle and Soprano Pipistrelle bats which have been seen hunting and living here. There have also been sightings of red squirrels in the forest which are now considered endangered animals due to the disappearance of their habitat and the competition from grey squirrels. A Red Squirrel Project is carried out at Falkland Palace to encourage them back into the gardens. A shelter was built in the orchard for invertebrate (i.e. insects and worms) and small animals which will encourage them to stay longer in the garden and perhaps live there. The orchard has been planted with native trees such as hawthorn, oak and willows which would have been growing here in the 15th century. The Maspie Burn running between the garden and the orchard is a habitat for water wildlife, including trout.\nBuilding materials\nFalkland Palace, entrance façade\nChapel Royal inside the South Range of Falkland Palace\nSome sandstone for the palace was quarried locally. Limestone for lime mortar was found and burnt on the Lomond Hills. In 1540, harder sandstone was quarried at Kingoodie near Dundee and shipped across the Tay to the haven of Lindores Abbey. Much of the timber, including imported \"Eastland boards\", deals, and rafters supplied by a Danish merchant called \"Kinnereis\", was bought at St Andrews and Dundee, where it was bound together into rafts called \"floats\" and towed to Newburgh or Lindores and Levenmouth. Other timber was bought at Leith at Kirkcaldy.[128]\nDescription\nThe palace has two wings arranged in an 'L' shape, now called the South and East Quarters or Ranges. The palace courtyard is entered through the gatehouse tower at the west end of the South Quarter. The external ashlar façade of the South Quarter has gunloops at basement level. Above these are the small windows of the private lodgings, and on the second level the large paired windows of the Chapel Royal. Between these windows are weathered niches and statues. The corbels show the instruments of the passion; the chapel at Falkland was dedicated to St Thomas and is the Catholic parish church for Falkland with Mass every Sunday at 9 a.m.[129]\nThe wallhead is finished with a decorated cornice and battlement which continues around the west side of the gate tower. To the east of the chapel there is small rectangular sectioned tower which once housed a circular staircase, and beyond is the partly reconstructed gable of the East Quarter. Although some writers have attributed part of the South Quarter to the time of James IV, the form of the gunloops, the continuous parapet, and the documented payments to Peter the Flemishman for the 5 statues in 1539 adequately demonstrate that the present appearance dates from the works of James V.[130] The entrance tower was built in 1541, and the accounts record the work of two master masons: \"to John Brownhill and Henry Bawtie for complete ending of the fore entry and tower ... and raising of certain chimneys in the south quarter.\"[131] Within the gate tower and south quarter, visitors can view the Keeper's Apartments in the tower, the Chapel Royal and gallery.\nThe East Quarter, apart from its courtyard façade is ruined. The centrally placed access tower, the Crosshouse, was reconstructed by the Marquis of Bute. The National Trust's architect, Schomberg Scott recreated the King and Queen's bedchambers within. The northern section of the East Quarter was originally a lodging built by James IV. The East Quarter was remodelled by the mason John Merlioun in 1538.[132] This part of the building, with its \"back galleries\" overlooking the garden was decayed in 1615.[133] In 1616 the master of works, James Murray was ordered to repair the flat roof of the King and Queen's galleries and the roof of the lodging of the East Quarter in anticipation of the visit of James VI.[134]\nComparable façade at Villers-Cotterêts\nThe South and East courtyard façades were decorated and unified with pilasters in a French Renaissance style between 1537 and 1542. Their appearance is comparable to the French Chateau of Villers-Cotterêts. The buttresses on the East are dated 1537, and on the South, where the masonry is more sophisticated, 1539. The later work may be connected with the arrival of Nicolas Roy, a French mason sent to Scotland in March 1539 by Antoinette of Bourbon, the mother of Mary of Guise.[135]\nThe chapel ceiling dates from the time of James V, as recent dendrochronology work by the AOC Group has confirmed.[136] It was constructed by the carpenter Richard Stewart, and was re-decorated for the visit of Charles I in 1633. James Murray, master of works, was ordered to repair the roof of the South Quarter in 1625, with instructions to \"have a special care and regard\" that the great ceiling of the Chapel be \"preserved and kept as far as possibly may be.\"[137]\nThe tennis court, Cross House, and the east turnpike stair turret were plastered and harled for James V by John Kelly and John Malcolm alias Callum. Some of the interiors were plastered by a French specialist craftsman Hector Beato.[138]\nThe courtyard was originally completed on the north with a great hall to the north. The footprint of the building was established by excavation and laid out with paving slabs by the 3rd Marquis of Bute. Beyond this area are the reconstructed footings of Falkland Castle. This was the site of the short-lived Nether Palace or Castlestead in the 17th century, known from a plan and elevation drawn by Alexander Edward.\nReal tennis court\nOn the lower ground in the gardens, slightly beyond the remains of the medieval castle uncovered c. 1900, lies the original real tennis court. The masons William Mason and Alexander Allardice, and others built the tennis court. Its walls were finished by Callum the pargeoner, or lime plasterer.[139] It is the world's oldest tennis court still in use. The roofed spectator area is home to a number of swallows during spring and summer. The court is home to the Falkland Palace Royal Tennis Club.\nReferences\nFurther reading\nDunbar, John G. (1999).

    "text": "Castle outside Arncroach, Fife, Scotland\nNot to be confused with Kellie's Castle.\nKellie Castle\nKellie Castle is a castle just outside Arncroach and below the dominant hill in the area, Kellie Law. It is about 4 kilometres north of Pittenweem in the East Neuk of Fife, Scotland.\nEarly history\nThe earliest records of Kellie go back to 1150 where it is mentioned in a charter issued by King David I. The first known owner was Robert of London, the illegitimate son of King William the Lion. By 1266 Kellie had passed to the Siward family, who had hailed from Northumbria and had assisted King Malcolm Canmore to overthrow Macbeth. The Siewards supported England during the wars of independence (1296-1328) and as a result Sir Richard Sieward forfeited his lands in Scotland after Bannockburn. However his daughter Helena Sieward, “Lady Kellie” retained Kellie. None of the buildings they occupied appear to have survived.\nIn about 1360 Helena, or Elena, assigned Kellie to her kinsman Walter Olifard (or Oliphant) of Aberdalgie who was married to Elizabeth, a daughter of Robert the Bruce. Thus began 250 years of occupation by the Oliphant family. The estate was signed over to a Siward relative, Walter Oliphant, in 1360 and the castle remained in the ownership of the Oliphant family until 1613. It was purchased by Sir Thomas Erskine, who had saved the life of King James VI during the Gowrie Conspiracy by killing Sir Alexander Ruthven. The King stayed at Kellie in 1617 during his only visit to Scotland after the Union of the Crowns, and he appointed Erskine as Earl of Kellie in 1619.\nIt is likely that the ceiling of what is now the library in the 1573 east tower was decorated in plaster in anticipation of a Royal visit by King James. This room may be the first in Scotland where plaster decoration was used ‘in the London style’ in preference to the painted beams and boarded ceilings that were generally fashionable in the early 17th century. Incorporated in the ceiling is the date \"1617\" and monogram \"T V F\" for Thomas Viscount Fenton, which title the King awarded Thomas Erskine in 1606.\nKellie Castle (rear view)\nOriginally a simple tower house, the lower section of what now constitutes the northwest tower is the oldest part of the castle, dating from around 1360, and is said to be haunted. In 1573 a new tower was built by the 4th Lord Oliphant to the east of the original tower. It is believed that the 4th Lord built the east tower as a jointure-house (a property set aside for the wife after the husband's death) for his wife Margaret. Between 1573 and 1606 the two towers were linked by a new range, terminated by another tower in the south-west, creating the T-plan layout that remains today. The castle is a fine example of Scots Baronial domestic architecture, with an imposing mix of gables, corbelled towers, and chimneys.\nFor much of the seventeenth century, the Castle was owned by the Erskines of Dirleton. Alexander Erskine (1615-1677), the third earl of Kellie, was an investigator in the 1666 case of Margaret Guthrie, an accused witch from Carnbee.[1] She was imprisoned in the tolbooth at Anstruther Wester sometime in early May.\nRecent history\nMethven Erskine the 10th Earl of Kellie died in 1829 to be succeeded by John Francis Miller Erskine as 11th Earl of Kellie. The castle was abandoned by Erskine and cleared of its contents at a muckle roup (public auction) in 1830. John Francis Miller Erskine was confirmed as 26th Earl of Mar in 1835 and the Earldom of Kellie was united with the Earldom of Mar. The property then seems to have fallen to James Maitland Hog of Newliston (thereafter titled \"of Newliston and Kellie\") but Hog made little use of the estate, and the castle lay abandoned for many years.[citation needed] In 1878 it was rented from the Earl of Mar and Kellie by James Lorimer, Regius Professor of Public Law at Edinburgh University, and father to Sir Robert Lorimer, the renowned Scottish architect.[2] The Lorimer family set about restoring the castle for use as a holiday retreat, but it soon became the family home. Robert Lorimer was instrumental in much of the restoration work, restoring magnificent plaster ceilings, painted panelling and furniture.\nThere are examples of Robert Lorimer’s work as an architect across the world. At Kellie we have the doocot and garden house as well as the restoration of the garden with his sister Caroline-Louise. The Kellie Castle survey drawing (1887) featured at Kellie, illustrates his draftsmanship. Close to Kellie is the renovation and extension of Lundie Cottage (1902) in Arncroach. The interesting dormer windows can be seen from the roadway, opposite the church, as you drive west into the village.\nFollowing the death of the professor the tenancy was taken by his wife Hannah in 1890. Robert Lorimer began the first of his alterations in 1900: building a doocot and garden house.[3]\nOn the death of Hannah in 1916 the tenancy was taken over by their son, John Henry Lorimer the famous Scottish painter. Robert then began work on restoring the main house, this previously having been resisted by Hannah.[3]\nUpon John's death in 1936, the tenancy lapsed and the house was cleared and the castle once again became vacant. In 1936 Sir Robert's son, the sculptor Hew Lorimer and his wife Mary, renewed the Lorimer tenancy. Hew and Mary Lorimer purchased the castle in 1948 and it remained in his ownership until 1970. Between 1970 and 1990 Hew continued to live in part of the castle and used the stable block as his studio.\nKellie Castle Gardens\nPresent day\nHew Lorimer sold the castle, together with 6.5 hectares of gardens and an organic walled garden to the National Trust for Scotland in 1970. The walled garden is 17th century, with late Victorian additions, and contains a fine collection of old-fashioned roses, fruit trees and herbaceous plants.\nThe main castle contents were given into the care of the Trust by the Secretary of State for Scotland and, in 1998 the Trust purchased the Lorimer family artifacts. Amongst these artifacts are included paintings by Hannah Cassels im Thurn, the eldest daughter of Hannah and James Lorimer.[4] The castle and gardens are open to the public, and there is a permanent exhibition of Hew Lorimer's work and studio in the old stables.\nInterior\nPhoebe Anna Traquair, who was an outstanding proponent of the Arts and Crafts philosophy, completed the painted panel above the fireplace in the drawing room in 1897. The painting is based on Botticelli's Primavera and was completed when John Henry Lorimer lived in the castle. Hew and Mary Lorimer, who took over the tenancy after John Henry, apparently did not like the painting and they had it covered in the late 1940s. They were careful not to damage the painting and they used cartridge paper with flour paste. The painting was restored in 1996 by the National Trust for Scotland following the death of Hew Lorimer who had remained at Kellie and lived in part of the east tower of the castle until 1990.\nThe tapestry now in the dining room is made up of at least two, possibly three, different tapestries. The centre and main element is a Flemish tapestry (1580) that depicts Europa and the Bull. This tapestry used to be located in the drawing room as illustrated in a Country Life photograph taken in 1964. The beauty of Europa inspired the love of Zeus, who approached her in the form of a white bull. He carried her away from Phoenicia to Crete. The Latin inscription, which does not refer or relate to the main tapestry –‘The young man has saved his wounded father, carried him back and put him on his horse'. The borders have been added at some later time.\nIn the 1930s John Henry Lorimer was vice-president of what was then known as the Edinburgh Astronomical Association and now the Astronomical Society of Edinburgh. Upon his death in 1936 he left a substantial legacy to the society who now award a medal in his honour.[5] The society owns a bust of John Henry and two of his paintings. The bust and both paintings, “Sunlight in the South Room, Kellie” and “The Long Shadows”, are exhibited at Kellie Castle.\nThe largest room in the castle, used by the Lorimers as the drawing room, is the Great Hall, completed circa 1606. On the west wall are two mirrors with eagle cresting, designed by Sir Robert Lorimer and made by Whytock and Reid of Edinburgh. These mirrors, hanging on either side of the west window, appear to have a magical effect. No matter how far back you go, your image appears to stay the same size.\nSee also\nEarl of Kellie\nList of places in Fife\nList of National Trust for Scotland properties\nReferences\n^ Jones, Ciaran (2021).

    "text": "Macduff's Castle and the Wemyss Caves\nMacDuff's Castle is a ruined castle near East Wemyss, in Fife, Scotland. The site is associated with the MacDuff Earls of Fife, the most powerful family in Fife in the Middle Ages, although nothing survives from this period. The present ruins are the remains of the home of the Wemyss family, who lived here from the 14th century, and their successors in the 16th century.[1]\nHistory\nIt is thought that a castle may have been built here by the MacDuff Mormaers, or Earls, of Fife in the 11th century, at the time of King Macbeth of Scotland (d. 1057). The Wemyss family, descendants of the MacDuffs, owned the property from the 14th century, and built the earliest part of the present castle. Edward I of England paid a visit here in 1304, staying with Sir Michael Wemyss. However, Wemyss later joined forces with Robert the Bruce, and Edward ordered the castle to be destroyed.[citation needed]\nAfter the Wemyss family moved to nearby Wemyss Castle, it passed to the Livingstones, and then in 1530 it was taken over by the Colvilles who built a second tower to the south-west, and enclosed a courtyard with a gatehouse. In 1637 the castle was bought by Sir John Wemyss of West Wemyss, from Lord Colville of Culross, and in 1651 the lands of East and West Wemyss were united as a single barony.[1]\nDescription\nThe ruins formerly comprised the remains of a four-storey 14th-century tower, and a five-storey 16th-century tower.[1] The two were connected by a 16th-century gatehouse range, with 17th-century walls containing gun loops.[1][2] However the eastern tower was demolished by Fife County Council in 1967 after a child was injured falling from it. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[3] A 16th-century dovecote formerly stood at the edge of the shore to the south of the castle, but was destroyed by sea erosion in the 1970s.[4] The castle remains the property of the Wemyss Estate.[1]\nGhostlore\nLocal ghostlore states that the castle is supposedly haunted by a \"Grey Lady\", said to be a Mary Sibbald who was found guilty of theft and died in the castle.[5]\nImages\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Macduff's Castle.\nAerial view of the castle\n56°09′44″N 3°03′29″W / 56.16222°N 3.05806°W / 56.16222; -3.05806\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Rossend Castle\nPainted ceiling from the castle preserved in the National Museum of Scotland\nRossend Castle is a historic building in Burntisland, a town on the south coast of Fife, Scotland.\nHistory\nA keep, known as the Tower of Kingorne Wester, was in existence on the site from 1119. It was later referred to as Burntisland Castle, and by 1382 was called Abbot's Hall, as it was the home of the Abbot of Dunfermline.[1] The present building is largely of the 16th century, though with a 13th-century basement, which contains lancet windows and may represent the remains of a chapel.[2] It was rebuilt by Peter Durie of Durie from 1552, and the arms of Abbot George Durie, and the date 1554, appear over the main door.[1]\nDuring the war of the Rough Wooing the English soldier John Luttrell landed at Burntisland on 28 December 1547. He burnt boats and buildings at the pier, and the owners of Rossend surrendered the castle to him.[3]\nMary, Queen of Scots, visited during her short personal reign (1561–1567). On 14 February 1562, the French messenger and poet Chastelard was discovered hiding under Mary's bed in the castle.[4]\nOn 11 May 1590 Sir Robert Melville hosted the Danish Admiral Peder Munk who was travelling to Falkland Palace to take possession of the lands granted to Anne of Denmark as part of her dowry.[5]\nIn April 1594 James VI came to Rossend from Leith with his guard, and unsuccessfully tried to capture two rebel supporters of the Earl of Bothwell, Archibald Wauchope of Niddrie and John Wemyss of Logie.[6] Probably in the first decades of the 17th-century, Sir Robert Melville commissioned a painted timber ceiling. The scheme includes his initials \"SRM\" which he used as a seal on his letters, and pictorial emblems copied from the Devises Heroïques of Claude Paradin and other print sources. The ceiling may have been part of a redecoration of the castle in 1617, when King James planned to visit during his \"salmon-like\" return to Scotland. Melville was instructed to make \"his house of Burntyland patent\" for his majesty's reception. One of the documented Scottish painters of the period, James Workman, lived in Burntisland.[7]\nThe castle was captured in 1651 by the soldiers of Oliver Cromwell, and in the later 17th century it was owned by the Wemyss family, who remodelled the top floor.\nBy 1765, it was owned by Murdoch Campbell, a Highlander from Skye, who probably gave the building its current name.[1]\nIn 1915 Thomas Ross was arrested whilst studying the castle, for sketching in a prohibited area, and fined five shillings.\nThe castle was acquired by the Town Council in 1952. In 1957, the Scottish renaissance painted ceilings was discovered and is now displayed in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.[1] The council threatened to demolish the property, which had been allowed to deteriorate, but it was saved after a public inquiry in 1972.[8] In 1975, the castle was bought by the architecture firm Robert Hurd & Partners, who restored it and retain the building as their offices. It is a category B listed building.[1]\nIt was bought in 2019 by private owners who have restored it\nSee also\nRestoration of castles in Scotland\nReferences\n56°3′31.4″N 3°14′25.0″W / 56.058722°N 3.240278°W / 56.058722; -3.240278\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Fife, Scotland, UK\nNot to be confused with St Andrew's Castle, Hamble.\nSt Andrews Castle is a ruin located in the coastal Royal Burgh of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland. The castle sits on a rocky promontory overlooking a small beach called Castle Sands and the adjoining North Sea. There has been a castle standing at the site since the times of Bishop Roger (1189–1202), son of the Earl of Leicester. It housed the burgh’s wealthy and powerful bishops while St Andrews served as the ecclesiastical centre of Scotland during the years before the Protestant Reformation. In their Latin charters, the Archbishops of St Andrews wrote of the castle as their palace, signing, \"apud Palatium nostrum.\"[1]\nThe castle's grounds are now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.[2] The site is entered through a visitor centre with displays on its history. Some of the best surviving carved fragments from the castle are displayed in the centre, which also has a shop.\nWars of Scottish Independence\nDuring the Wars of Scottish Independence, the castle was destroyed and rebuilt several times as it changed hands between the Scots and the English. Soon after the sack of Berwick in 1296 by Edward I of England, the castle was taken and made ready for the English king in 1303. In 1314, however, after the Scottish victory at Bannockburn, the castle was retaken and repaired by Bishop William Lamberton, Guardian of Scotland, a loyal supporter of King Robert the Bruce. The English had recaptured it again by the 1330s and reinforced its defences in 1336, but were not successful in holding the castle. Sir Andrew Moray, Regent of Scotland in the absence of David II, recaptured it after a siege lasting three weeks. Shortly after this, in 1336–1337, it was destroyed by the Scots to prevent the English from once again using it as a stronghold.\nIt remained in this ruined state until Bishop Walter Trail rebuilt it at the turn of the century. His castle forms the basis of what can be seen today. He completed work on the castle in about 1400 and died within its walls in 1401.\nHome to kings\nSeveral notable figures spent time in the castle over the next several years. James I of Scotland (1406–1437) received part of his education from Bishop Henry Wardlaw, the founder of the University of St Andrews in 1410. A later resident, Bishop James Kennedy, was a trusted advisor of James II of Scotland (1437–1460).\nUsed as a prison\nDuring these years, the castle also served as a notorious prison. The castle's bottle dungeon is a dank and airless pit cut out of solid rock below the north-west tower. It housed local miscreants who fell under the Bishop's jurisdiction as well as several more prominent individuals such as David Stuart, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Murdoch Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany in 1425, while Archbishop Patrick Graham, who was judged to be insane and might have been imprisoned at this place for a while, actually died in captivity in Lochleven Castle in 1478.\nReformation and siege\nMain article: Siege of St Andrews Castle\nDuring the Scottish Reformation, the castle became a centre of religious persecution and controversy. Referring to the bottle dungeon the Scottish reformer, John Knox, wrote, \"Many of God's Children were imprisoned here.\" In 1521, James Beaton, then Archbishop of Glasgow, won the seat of St Andrews and took up residence in the castle. Beaton altered the defences to enable the castle to withstand a heavy artillery attack, which was a threat as tensions grew between English Protestants and Scottish Catholics. A new artillery blockhouse was constructed. In 1538 James Beaton was succeeded by his ambitious and wealthy nephew, Cardinal David Beaton.\nMuch is known about life at the castle from the account book of David Beaton. Beer was brewed by the Widow Fallousdale. In 1541 a whale beached at Byrehills (now Boarhills) was brought to the castle and salted. The Cardinal employed William Blair as a drummer. Onion and lettuce were grown in the castle garden. Two priests, Henry Balfour and James Bykartoun, were masters of work, supervising improvements to the castle and gardens. Christopher Grymmerschere, a French military engineer, provided guns, and Master Wolf made new cannon, and John Fynnyk was the castle gunner. Coal for the castle was shipped from West Wemyss.[3] Three women from Edinburgh and Dunfermline accused of witchcraft were held at the castle and executed by burning on 10 October 1542.[4]\nMine tunnel dug during the siege in 1546\nCardinal Beaton's strong opposition to the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, with Prince Edward (later King Edward VI), the son and heir of Henry VIII of England, helped to spark renewed fighting in 1544. Scottish Protestants were increasingly viewed as dangerous turncoats who sided with the English. In 1546 David Beaton imprisoned the Protestant preacher George Wishart (1513-1546) in the castle's Sea Tower and had him burnt at the stake in front of the castle walls on 1 March. Today, brick lettering with his initials marks the spot where he died. In May the same year, Wishart's friends conspired against the cardinal. On 26 May they gained entry to the castle by disguising themselves as masons when some building work was in progress. After overcoming the garrison, they murdered Cardinal Beaton and hung his body from his window on the front of the castle.\nFollowing this murder, the Protestants took refuge in the castle and formed the first Protestant congregation in Scotland. A long siege was ordered by the Scottish Regent, James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran. In October 1546 a mine was begun by the attackers which was successfully counter-mined by the defenders.[5] Both the mine and counter-mine cut through solid rock. They were rediscovered in 1879 and remain open to the public today. Arran heard that an English army was on its way to relieve the Castle and asked Fife Lairds like John Wemyss of that Ilk to come by 4 November 1546, bringing his followers and whatever artillery they had to resist a sea invasion.[6] Although Henry VIII made plans to assist the Protestants within the castle,[7] the invasion never came and his son Edward VI did not send aid.\nDuring an armistice in April 1547, John Knox entered the castle and served as the garrison's preacher for the remainder of the siege. For a time Knox had the freedom to pass to and from the castle to preach in the parish church. This peaceful interlude came to end, however, when a French fleet arrived bringing an Italian engineer Leone Strozzi who directed a devastating artillery bombardment to dislodge the Protestant lairds. The lairds knew an expert was in the field when their own Italian engineer observed cannon being winched into position with ropes rather than exposing the besiegers to their fire.[8] Guns were also placed on St Salvator's and the cathedral towers. One of the largest Scottish cannon was called \"thrawynmouthe.\"[9] The castle was quickly rendered indefensible, within six hours according to Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie.[10] The defeated Protestants were taken away with some imprisoned in France while others, including Knox, were condemned to the galleys.\nDecline and current condition\nBeaton's arms on a panel believed to have been removed from one of his private apartments in the castle\nFollowing this Protestant defeat, the castle was substantially rebuilt by Archbishop John Hamilton, the illegitimate brother of Regent Arran, and successor to Dr. David Cardinal Beaton. But following his death in 1571 it was mainly occupied by a succession of constables. Parliament separated the castle from the archbishopric in 1606, and it was granted to the Earl of Dunbar, constable since 1603. In 1612 it was returned to Archbishop George Gledstanes, but further attempts to re-establish the former estates of the Archbishop failed. With the eventual success of the Reformation in Scotland, the office of the bishop was increasingly eroded until it was finally abolished by William of Orange in 1689. Deprived of any function, the castle fell rapidly into ruin. By 1656 it had fallen into such disrepair that the burgh council ordered the use of its materials in repairing the pier. The principal remains are a portion of the south wall enclosing a square tower, the \"bottle dungeon,\" the kitchen tower, and the underground mine and counter-mine.\nGallery 1843-44 photo of St. Andrews Castle by Robert Adamson The courtyard of St Andrews Castle The ruins of St Andrews Castle from the south east The front of St Andrews Castle Inside St Andrews Castle St Andrews Castle reflected in the sea\nFootnotes\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to St Andrews Castle.\nHistoric Environment Scotland: Visitor guide\n56°20′31″N 2°47′24″W / 56.3419°N 2.7901°W / 56.3419; -2.7901\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

Crookston Castle was built by the Stewarts of Darnley around 1400, and is set within earthworks constructed in the 12th century. Once the property of the earls and dukes of Lennox, the castle was extensively repaired following a siege in 1544, and it is the only surviving medieval castle in Glasgow.\nHistory\nCrookston is surrounded by a defensive ring ditch that dates back to the 12th century when Sir Robert de Croc, who also gave his name to the village of Crookston, built a timber and earth castle. Remains of a chapel founded by de Croc in 1180 have been uncovered.[1] Evidence of an even earlier fortification on the same site has also been found. The lands of Crookston were bought by Sir Alan Stewart in 1330, and passed to Sir John Stewart of Darnley, in 1361. The Darnley Stewarts replaced the early castle with the present stone structure around 1400.[2][3]\nIn 1489 the Stewart Earl of Lennox rebelled against James IV. James responded by bringing the cannon Mons Meg from Edinburgh and bombarding the castle, virtually destroying its western end and ensuring a quick surrender.[4][5] On 3 April 1544, the castle was besieged and taken[2] by the Earl of Arran and Cardinal Beaton, while the then Earl of Lennox was defending Glasgow Castle. At this time, Crookston was regarded as the principal house of the earls of Lennox.[6] Regent Arran installed five gunners in the castle in May 1544.[7]\nMost famous of the Darnley Stewarts was Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who was second husband to Mary, Queen of Scots. It may have been at Crookston that the couple were betrothed,[8] under a yew tree.[5] The yew was felled in 1816,[9] and a model of Crookston Castle, now on display in Pollok House, was carved from its wood.[10] In 1572, Crookston was granted to another Stewart, Charles, the Earl of Lennox.[11]\nIn 1703 the Duke of Lennox sold the castle to the Duke of Montrose, and it remained the property of the Dukes of Montrose until 1757, when it was sold by William Graham, 2nd Duke of Montrose to the Maxwells of Pollok.[5] Following several years of abandonment, the castle was partially restored by the Maxwells in 1847, to honour Queen Victoria's visit to Glasgow. In 1931, Crookston became the first property acquired by the National Trust for Scotland, having been presented by Sir John Maxwell Stirling-Maxwell, who was one of the Trust's founder members and first Vice Presidents.[10] During the Second World War the north-eastern tower was used as an aircraft watch tower.[12] Today, Crookston Castle is a scheduled monument.[13] Its maintenance is the responsibility of Historic Environment Scotland, and the castle is open to the public.[14] It is the second-oldest building in Glasgow, after Glasgow Cathedral.[15]\nArchitecture\nCrookston Castle in 1900\nCrookston Castle sits atop a natural hill, emphasised by the early ring ditch, which can still be seen. To the north is a steep drop to the Levern Water. The castle has a rectangular main block, which was strengthened by a tower at each corner. This formed an irregular 'X-plan' shape, an unusual layout also seen at Hermitage Castle.[11] Only the north-east corner tower survives to its former height, as well as the basement of the south-east tower. The two western towers were destroyed in the 15th century and never rebuilt, repairs in the 19th century have obscured even the remains of these. The main body of the castle measures about 19 m by 12 m, with walls up to 3.7 m thick, and the north-east tower is around 6m square.[16]\nThe entrance is on the north side, adjacent to the north-east tower, and defended by a portcullis and two doors. A straight mural stair leads up to the right, while ahead is a barrel-vaulted basement with slit windows and a well. The hall is at first-floor level, and was also vaulted, rising to 8.3 m high. A turnpike stair in the south-east corner gave access to another storey above the hall, as well as upper rooms in the eastern towers. The towers had one room on each floor. In the basement of the north-east tower is a prison only accessible from above, while at the top there is access to the four storeys of the tower, via modern iron ladders, opening onto an impressive view from the roof. The top of the north-east tower, including corbels, was also rebuilt in the 19th century.\nVerse and fiction\nThe poets Robert Burns, William Motherwell and Robert Tannahill have all mentioned the castle in their works, while Sir Walter Scott, in his 1820 novel The Abbot, suggested Mary, Queen of Scots, watched the Battle of Langside from beneath its yew tree, although the topography makes this impossible.[17]\nNotes\nReferences\nCoventry, Martin The Castles of Scotland (3rd Edition), Goblinshead, 2001\nLindsay, Maurice The Castles of Scotland, Constable & Co. 1986\nMason, Gordon The Castles of Glasgow and the Clyde, Goblinshead, 2000\nSalter, Mike The Castles of South West Scotland, Folly Publications, 1993\nSee also\nCowden Hall, East Renfrewshire\nExternal links Media related to Crookston Castle at Wikimedia Commons\nHistoric Environment Scotland: Visitor guide\nAncient Scotland\nImages of Crookston Castle\n55°50′06″N 4°21′21″W / 55.83513°N 4.35584°W / 55.83513; -4.35584\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",
