    "text": "Castle in Aberdeen, Scotland\nAberdeen Castle was a late Middle Ages fortification,[1] in Aberdeen, Scotland.[2] It was situated on Castle Hill, a site today known as the Castlegate, and the location of the castle is now occupied by blocks of flats.[3]\nBurned and demolished\nIt is thought the castle and fortifications were slighted[4] by King Robert the Bruce as was his policy on recaptured castles in June 1308, during the Wars of Scottish Independence immediately following the Harrying of Buchan. Bruce and his men laid siege to the castle before massacring the English Garrison to prevent its use by the English troops of Edward II. It is said the Scots showed no mercy but \"slew every man who fell into their hands. Edward I, indeed, had already set the example of executing his prisoners. It was not to be expected that the other side would fail to follow the same course\"[5] However, as of August 1308, Gilbert Pecche and the last troops were allowed to leave Aberdeen; this obviously cannot be accurate.[1] On 10 July 1308, English ships left Hartlepool to help the English garrison.[6] Legend tells that the city's motto, Bon Accord, came from the password used to initiate Bruce's final push and destruction of the castle.[7][8]\nSurrender to the English\nThe castle was surrendered to the English in 1295, and on 14 April 1296, the English King, Edward I arrived in Aberdeen and stayed in the castle as part of his suppression of the east coast of Scotland, having defeated the Scots.[9]\nWallace\nHowever, the following year, after defeating the English at Dunnottar Castle in 1297, William Wallace marched his men to Aberdeen during their campaign to retake the east coast for the Scots.\nThey found the English hastily preparing to leave in an armada of one hundred ships. The speed of Wallace's arrival from Dunottar caught the English unawares, and at low tide, the stranded ships were attacked in the harbour, the crew and soldiers slaughtered, the cargo taken, and the ships burnt.\nJohn Balliol\nThe English Sheriff of Aberdeen, Sir Henry de Lazom had been left in charge of the Castle, but during the chaos of the attack, he defected, declaring it in the name of the Scottish King, John Balliol.[10][11]\nReferences\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle and museum in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, UK\nDelgatie Castle is a castle near Turriff, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nA castle has stood on the site of Delgatie Castle since the year 1030 AD, although the earliest parts of the castle standing today were built between 1570 and 1579.[1] Additional wings and a chapel were added in 1743.\nThe castle was stripped from the disgraced Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, after the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and given to Clan Hay (later to become the Earls of Erroll). Mary, Queen of Scots, was a guest at the castle in 1562 after the Battle of Corrichie.[2]\nLike many castles, Delgatie is rumoured to be haunted. A number of reports of a ghostly red-haired figure, supposedly one Alexander Hay, were made by soldiers posted there during the Second World War. The castle's information boards, mostly written by Captain Hay who restored the house in the 1950s, recount that the ghost was first seen when a body was found bricked up in a priest hole.\nArchitecturally, the castle consists of a keep, adjoining house and two later wings. Notable features include a very wide turnpike stair and painted ceilings dating from the 16th century in two of the rooms, one dating from 1592, and the other from 1597.[3] In many places may be seen the Hay family arms including the three cattle yokes which recall a farmer and his two sons who were instrumental in the defeat of a Danish raiding party at Cruden Bay. (See Clan Hay for more detail.)\nToday, the castle and its gardens are owned by the Delgatie Castle Trust. The castle, grounds and café are open to the public throughout the summer months and suites within the castle itself and a number of cottages on the estate are available to rent. There is also a popular fishing site on the river passing through.\nGallery Delgatie Castle in 2017 Painted ceiling in Delgatie Castle\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Delgatie Castle.\nDelgatie Castle website\nReferences\n57°32′39″N 2°24′43″W / 57.5443°N 2.4120°W / 57.5443; -2.4120\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_Castle",
    "text": "Tower house in Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nDrum Castle is a castle near Drumoak in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. For centuries it was the seat of the chief of Clan Irvine.[1] The place-name Drum is derived from Gaelic druim, 'ridge'.[2] The site is located approximately 6+1⁄2 miles (10.5 kilometres) northeast of Banchory and 3 miles (5 kilometres) west of Peterculter. The property is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland and is open to the public.\nHistory\nThe original 13th-century tower of Drum Castle has been suggested as the work of medieval architect Richard Cementarius, who built the Brig o' Balgownie, the first Bridge of Don, in Old Aberdeen. It is believed to be one of the three oldest tower houses in Scotland (and notably unaltered). A large wing was added in 1619 by the 9th laird, and further alterations were made during the Victorian era.\nThe castle and its grounds were granted to William de Irwyn in 1323 by Robert the Bruce, and remained in the possession of Clan Irvine until 1975. William de Irwyn (of the Irvings of Bonshaw clan) was armour bearer/secretary (and neighbour) to King Robert the Bruce. In June 1636 Sir Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum and his wife Magdalene Scrimgeour were censured for harbouring the outlaw Gilderoy.[3] Drum played a role in the Covenanting Rebellion (as did nearby Muchalls Castle) leading to its being attacked and sacked three times.\nThe castle in 1829 (by John Preston Neale)\nIn the 19th century, it was the home of Alexander Forbes Irvine of Drum FRSE (1818–1892).[4] He had inherited the estate in 1861, on the death of his father. In 1875/1876, he arranged for a restoration of the courtyard, and the addition of an arched entrance and angle tower.[5][6] He was also partly responsible for a restoration of the chapel.[7]\nThere was an older church located here; it was modified to create the chapel in the 1500s and 1600s. In 1857, the west window was enlarged and the cross was added; a new roof was also installed and some restoration of the interior was completed.[8][9]\nThe site was once served by Drum railway station on the Deeside Railway. Service was discontinued in 1951.\nRecent status\nThe castle has been a Category-A Listed property since 1987. The report states that the agreement with the National Trust was made in 1964 by Mr H.Q. Forbes Irvine, the 24th Laird, and that the agreement came into force in 1976, after 650 years of ownership by the Irvine Lairds. The summary states that the tower was built in 1280–1300, that the Jacobean Wing was added in 1619 and that modifications were made ca. 1800, 1840 and 1875. The Chapel is Category-B Listed as are the Walled Garden and East Lodge; in 1987, the garden was \"derelict\".[10]\nThe chapel, dining hall and estate may be hired for weddings and corporate functions. The current (early 2020) NTS website, however, discusses its Garden of Historic Roses, spread out over four distinct areas. The grand Victorian library with over 4,000 books was one of the attractions; the castle was also offering a \"programme of temporary exhibitions throughout the year\".[11][12] A tourism website added that the castle \"contains superb furniture and paintings. In the 16th-century chapel are a beautiful stained glass window and the Augsburg silver Madonna\". The site has a playground, a small shop and a tearoom.[13]\nThe castle, gardens and estate are open to visitors throughout the year.[14] During 2019, 47,446 people visited the castle.[15]\nArea's ancient history\nPrehistoric habitation of the local area is known through archaeological sites such as Balbridie. Roman legions marched from Raedykes to nearby Normandykes as they sought higher ground evading the bogs of Red Moss and other low-lying mosses associated with the Burn of Muchalls. That march used the Elsick Mounth, one of the ancient trackways crossing the Grampian Mountains; the situation of the Elsick Mounth terminating at a ford to the River Dee is thought to have been instrumental in the strategic siting of Drum Castle as a point to monitor traffic on the Elsick Mounth[16] lying west of Netherley.\nGallery The Rose Garden at Drum Castle Walled Garden, Drum Castle Gateway of the Walled Garden at Drum Castle North-East corner of the Walled Garden at Drum Castle Southern boundary of the Walled Garden at Drum Castle Drum Castle Chapel Drum Castle chapel Interior & Altar\nReferences\nExternal links\nDrum Castle at National Trust of Scotland\nSummer Snow - Cottonwood tree at Drum Castle\nViews of Drum Castle and chapel\n360 Virtual Tour of Drum Castle Grounds\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Ruined castle in Scotland\nRemains of Dundarg Castle, and the modern house on the site, overlooking Aberdour Bay\nDundarg Castle is a ruined castle about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north-northeast of New Aberdour, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, built within the ramparts of an earlier Iron Age promontory fort.[1] It was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of North-East Aberdeenshire,[2] and by Charles McKean as \"Scotland's answer to Tintagel\".[3] It became a small Celtic monastery for a period.[4]\nStructure\nThe site consists of a triangle of gently sloping ground flanked by steep slopes on all sides, linked to a flat-topped elongated promontory extending to the north-east, surrounded by 20 metres (66 ft) high sandstone cliffs.[5] Its name comes from the Gaelic dun dearg, meaning red fort or castle, referring to the colour of the sandstone.[5]\nHistory\nThe 10th-century Book of Deer records the existence of a cathair or fortified place at Aberdour.[5]\nIt was built in the 13th century by the Comyn family, but was dismantled, probably by Robert the Bruce, in 1308. It was rebuilt in 1334 by Henry de Beaumont, but slighted almost immediately, after a famous siege by Sir Andrew Moray. Many medieval objects providing evidence of this double destruction were found in excavations in 1911-12 and 1950-51, led by W. Douglas Simpson.\nThe only substantial part of the castle remaining is the inner gatehouse, which survives to a height of about 18 feet (5.5 m). The upper part was rebuilt in the middle of the 16th century, probably following the Coastal Defence Commission of 1550, and there is some evidence that it was provided with gunloops at that time. The site was finally abandoned in the mid-17th century. A house was built on part of the site in 1938, reputedly by and for Wing Commander David Vaughan Carnegie, using stone from the former Aberdour Free Church.[6][7]\nThe castle and promontory fort are protected as a scheduled monument,[8] while the modern house is a category B listed building.[7]\nReferences\nBibliography\nBeveridge, W.

    "text": "Ruined castle in Scotland\nFor ships of this name, see RMS Dunottar Castle and MS Dunnottar Castle.\n\"Dunnottar\" redirects here. For other uses, see Dunnottar (disambiguation).\nDunnottar Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Fhoithear, \"fort on the shelving slope\")[1] is a ruined medieval fortress located upon a rocky headland on the northeast coast of Scotland, about 2 miles (3 kilometres) south of Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire. The surviving buildings are largely of the 15th and 16th centuries, but the site is believed to have been fortified in the Early Middle Ages. Dunnottar has played a prominent role in the history of Scotland through to the 18th-century Jacobite risings because of its strategic location and defensive strength.\nDunnottar is best known as the place where the Honours of Scotland, the Scottish crown jewels, were hidden from Oliver Cromwell's invading army in the 17th century. The property of the Keiths from the 14th century, and the seat of the Earl Marischal, Dunnottar declined after the last Earl forfeited his titles by taking part in the Jacobite rebellion of 1715. The castle was restored in the 20th century and is now open to the public.\nThe ruins of the castle are spread over 1.4 hectares (3+1⁄2 acres), surrounded by steep cliffs that drop to the North Sea, 160 feet (50 metres) below. A narrow strip of land joins the headland to the mainland, along which a steep path leads up to the gatehouse. The various buildings within the castle include the 14th-century tower house as well as the 16th-century palace. Dunnottar Castle is a scheduled monument,[2] and twelve structures on the site were listed buildings.[3]\nHistory\nEarly Middle Ages\nThis historic view of Dunnottar Castle by the Dutch engineer John Slezer is now recognised as an incorrect labelling by his engraver. It is actually Wemyss Castle in Fife\nA chapel at Dunnottar is said to have been founded by St Ninian in the 5th century,[4] although it is not clear when the site was first fortified, but in any case the legend is late and highly implausible. Possibly the earliest written reference to the site is found in the Annals of Ulster which record two sieges of 'Dún Foither' in 681 and 694. The earlier event has been interpreted as an attack by Brude, the Pictish king of Fortriu, to extend his power over the north-east coast of Scotland.[5] The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba records that King Donald II of Scotland, the first ruler to be called rí Alban (King of Alba), was killed at Dunnottar during an attack by Vikings in 900.[6] The English king Æthelstan led a force into Scotland in 934, and raided as far north as Dunnottar according to the account of Symeon of Durham.[7]\nW. D. Simpson speculated that a motte might lie under the present castle, but excavations in the 1980s failed to uncover substantive evidence of early medieval fortification. The discovery of a group of Pictish stones at Dunnicaer, a nearby sea stack, has prompted speculation that Dún Foither was actually located on the adjacent headland of Bowduns, 3 miles (5 km) to the north.[8]\nLater Middle Ages\nDuring the reign of King William the Lion (ruled 1165–1214), Dunnottar was a centre of local administration for The Mearns.[9] The castle is named in the Roman de Fergus, an early 13th-century Arthurian romance, in which the hero Fergus must travel to Dunnottar to retrieve a magic shield.[10][11] In May 1276, a church on the site was consecrated by William Wishart, Bishop of St Andrews.[10] The poet Blind Harry relates that William Wallace captured Dunnottar from the English in 1297, during the Wars of Scottish Independence. He is said to have imprisoned 4,000 English prisoners of war in the church and burned them alive.[4]\nIn 1336, Edward III of England ordered William Sinclair, 8th Baron of Roslin, to sail eight ships to the partially ruined Dunnottar for the purpose of rebuilding and fortifying the site as a forward resupply base for his northern campaign. Sinclair took with him 160 soldiers, horses, and a corps of masons and carpenters.[12] Edward himself visited in July,[13] but the English efforts were undone before the end of the year when the Scottish Regent Sir Andrew Murray led a force that captured and again destroyed the defences of Dunnottar.[4]\nIn the 14th century, Dunnottar was granted to William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland (d.1370);[14] in 1346, a licence to crenellate was issued by David II.[15][16] Around 1359, William Keith, Marischal of Scotland, married Margaret Fraser, niece of Robert the Bruce, and was granted the barony of Dunnottar at this time. Keith then gave the lands of Dunnottar to his daughter Christian and son-in-law William Lindsay of Byres, but in 1392 an excambion (exchange) was agreed whereby Keith regained Dunnottar and Lindsay took lands in Fife.[14][17] William Keith completed construction of the tower house at Dunnottar, but was excommunicated for building on the consecrated ground associated with the parish church. Keith had provided a new parish church closer to Stonehaven, but was forced to write to the Pope, Benedict XIII, who issued a bull in 1395 lifting the excommunication.[14] William Keith's descendants were made Earls Marischal in the mid 15th century, and they held Dunottar until the 18th century.[4]\n16th-century rebuilding\nGeorge Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, painted by Cosmo Alexander\nJames IV came to Dunnottar on 15 October 1504. A child played a musical instrument called a monochord for him, and he gave money to poor people. The king had brought his Italian minstrels and an African drummer, known as the \"More taubronar\".[18]\nThrough the 16th century, the Keiths improved and expanded their principal seats: at Dunnottar and also at Keith Marischal in East Lothian. James IV visited Dunnottar in 1504, and in 1531 James V exempted the Earl's men from military service on the grounds that Dunnottar was one of the \"principall strenthis of our realme\".[19] Mary, Queen of Scots, visited in 1562 after the Battle of Corrichie,[20][21] and returned in 1564.[4] James VI stayed for 10 days in 1580, as part of his progress through Fife and Angus,[22] during which a meeting of the Privy Council was convened at Dunnottar.[23] King James came again on 17 April 1589 and spent the night at Cowie watching for the Catholic rebel earls of Huntly and Erroll.[24] During the rebellion of Catholic nobles in 1592, Dunnottar was captured by Captain Carr on behalf of the Earl of Huntly, but was restored to Lord Marischal just a few weeks later.[25]\nIn 1581, George Keith succeeded as 5th Earl Marischal, and began a large-scale reconstruction that saw the medieval fortress converted into a more comfortable home. As the founder of Marischal College in Aberdeen, the 5th Earl valued Dunnottar as much for its dramatic situation as for its security.[26] A \"palace\" comprising a series of ranges around a quadrangle was built on the north-eastern cliffs, creating luxurious living quarters with sea views. The 13th-century chapel was restored and incorporated into the quadrangle.[15] An impressive stone gatehouse was constructed, now known as Benholm's Lodging, featuring numerous gun ports facing the approach. Although impressive, these are likely to have been fashionable embellishments rather than genuine defensive features.[27] The earl had a suite of 'Samson' tapestries which may have represented his religious outlook.[28]\nCivil wars\nFurther information: Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms\nWilliam Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, painted by George Jamesone in 1636\nIn 1639, William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, came out in support of the Covenanters, a Presbyterian movement who opposed the established Episcopal Church and the changes which Charles I was attempting to impose. With James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, he marched against the Catholic James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne, Earl of Huntly, and defeated an attempt by the Royalists to seize Stonehaven. However, when Montrose changed sides to the Royalists and marched north, Marischal remained in Dunnottar, even when given command of the area by Parliament, and even when Montrose burned Stonehaven.[29]\nMarischal then joined with the Engager faction, who had made a deal with the king, and led a troop of horse to the Battle of Preston (1648) in support of the royalists.[29] Following the execution of Charles I in 1649, the Engagers gave their allegiance to his son and heir. Charles II was proclaimed king, arriving in Scotland in June 1650. He visited Dunnottar in July 1650,[29] but his presence in Scotland prompted Oliver Cromwell to lead a force into Scotland, defeating the Scots at Dunbar in September 1650.[30]\nHonours of Scotland\nCharles II was crowned at Scone Palace on 1 January 1651, at which the Honours of Scotland (the regalia of crown, sword and sceptre) were used. However, with Cromwell's troops in Lothian, the honours could not be returned to Edinburgh. The Earl Marischal, as Marischal of Scotland, had formal responsibility for the honours,[29] and in June the Privy Council duly decided to place them at Dunnottar.[17] They were brought to the castle by Katherine Drummond, hidden in sacks of wool.[31] Sir George Ogilvie (or Ogilvy) of Barras was appointed lieutenant-governor of the castle, and given responsibility for its defence.[32]\nIn November 1651, Cromwell's troops called on Ogilvie to surrender, but he refused. During the subsequent blockade of the castle, the removal of the Honours of Scotland was planned by Elizabeth Douglas, wife of Sir George Ogilvie, and Christian Fletcher, wife of James Granger, minister of Kinneff Parish Church. The king's papers were first removed from the castle by Anne Lindsay, a kinswoman of Elizabeth Douglas, who walked through the besieging force with the papers sewn into her clothes.[31] Two stories exist regarding the removal of the honours themselves. Fletcher stated in 1664 that over the course of three visits to the castle in February and March 1652, she carried away the crown, sceptre, sword and sword case hidden amongst sacks of goods. Another account, given in the 18th century by a tutor to the Earl Marischal, records that the honours were lowered from the castle onto the beach, where they were collected by Fletcher's servant and carried off in a creel (basket) of seaweed. Having smuggled the honours from the castle, Fletcher and her husband buried them under the floor of the Old Kirk at Kinneff.[31]\nBy May 1652 the commander of the blockade, Colonel Thomas Morgan, had taken delivery of the artillery necessary for the reduction of Dunnottar.[32] Ogilvie surrendered on 24 May, on condition that the garrison could go free. Finding the honours gone, the Cromwellians imprisoned Ogilvie and his wife in the castle until the following year, when a false story was put about suggesting that the honours had been taken overseas.[32] Much of the castle property was removed, including twenty-one brass cannons,[33] and Marischal was required to sell further lands and possessions to pay fines imposed by Cromwell's government.[29]\nAt the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the honours were removed from Kinneff Church and returned to the king. Ogilvie quarrelled with Marischal's mother over who would take credit for saving the honours,[29] though he was eventually rewarded with a baronetcy. Fletcher was awarded 2,000 merks by Parliament but the sum was never paid.[31]\nWhigs and Jacobites\nDunnottar drawn by John Slezer in 1693\nReligious and political conflicts continued to be played out at Dunnottar through the 17th and early 18th centuries. In 1685, during the rebellion of the Earl of Argyll against the new king James VII, 167 Covenanters were seized and held in a cellar at Dunnottar. The prisoners included 122 men and 45 women associated with the Whigs, an anti-Royalist group within the Covenanter movement, and had refused to take an oath of allegiance to the new king.[34] The Whigs were imprisoned from May 24 until late July. A group of 25 escaped, although two of these were killed in a fall from the cliffs, and another 15 were recaptured.[35] Five prisoners died in the vault, and 37 of the Whigs were released after taking the oath of allegiance.[34] The remaining prisoners were transported to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, as part of a colonisation scheme devised by George Scot of Pitlochie. Many, like Scot himself, died on the voyage.[36] The cellar, located beneath the \"King's Bedroom\" in the 16th-century castle buildings, has since become known as the \"Whigs' Vault\".[34]\nBoth the Jacobites (supporters of the exiled Stuarts) and the Hanoverians (supporters of George I and his descendants) used Dunnottar Castle. In 1689, during Viscount Dundee's campaign in support of the deposed James VII, the castle was garrisoned for William III and Mary II with Lord Marischal appointed captain.[37] Seventeen suspected Jacobites from Aberdeen were seized and held in the fortress for around three weeks, including George Liddell, professor of mathematics at Marischal College.[38] In the Jacobite Rising of 1715 George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal, took an active role with the rebels, leading cavalry at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. After the subsequent abandonment of the rising Lord Marischal fled to the Continent, eventually becoming French ambassador for Frederick the Great of Prussia. Meanwhile, in 1716, his titles and estates including Dunnottar were declared forfeit to the crown.[39]\nLater history\nDunnottar Castle by James Cassie, 1857\nDunnottar Castle by Waller Hugh Paton, 1867\nThe seized estates of the Earl Marischal were purchased in 1720 for £41,172, by the York Buildings Company who dismantled much of the castle.[17] In 1761, the Earl briefly returned to Scotland and bought back Dunnottar only to sell it five years later to Alexander Keith (1736–1819),[40] an Edinburgh lawyer who served as Knight Marischal of Scotland.[17] Dunnottar was held by Alexander Keith and then his son, Sir Alexander Keith (1768–1832) before being inherited in 1852 by Sir Patrick Keith-Murray of Ochtertyre, who in turn sold it in July 1873 to Major Alexander Innes of Cowie and Raemoir for about £80,000.[41] It was purchased by Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, in 1925, after which his wife embarked on a programme of repairs.[34] Since that time, the castle has remained in the family, and has been open to the public, attracting 52,500 visitors in 2009,[42] and over 135,000 visitors in 2019.[43]\nDunnottar Castle, and the headland on which is stands, was designated as a Scheduled monument in 1970.[2]\nIn 1972, twelve of the structures at Dunnottar were listed.[3] Three buildings were listed at category A as being of \"national importance\": the keep;[44] the entrance gateway;[45] and Benholm's Lodging.[46] The remaining listings were at category B as being of \"regional importance\".[47] However, in 2018, the listed status for those buildings was removed as part of Historic Environment Scotland's \"Dual Designation 2A Project\".[44][45][48][46][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56]\nThe Hon. Charles Anthony Pearson, the younger son of the 3rd Viscount Cowdray, currently owns and runs Dunnottar Castle which is part of the 210-square-kilometre (81 sq mi) Dunecht Estates.[57] Portions of the 1990 film Hamlet, starring Mel Gibson and Glenn Close, were shot there.[58] In the Disney movie Brave, Dunnottar Castle was chosen for Merida's home.\nDescription\nPlan of Dunnottar Castle Key: A Gatehouse and Benholm's Lodging · B Tunnels · C Tower house · D Forge · E Waterton's Lodging · F Stables · G Palace · H Chapel · I Postern gate · J Whigs' Vault · K Bowling green · L Sentry box · M Cliffs · N North Sea\nDunnottar's strategic location allowed its owners to control the coastal terrace between the North Sea cliffs and the hills of the Mounth, 2+1⁄4 miles (3.6 km) inland, which enabled access to and from the north-east of Scotland.[59] The site is accessed via a steep, 2,600-foot (790 m) footpath (with modern staircases) from a car park on the coastal road, or via a 3-kilometre (2 mi) cliff-top path from Stonehaven.\nDunnottar's several buildings, put up between the 13th and 17th centuries, are arranged across a headland covering around 1.4 hectares (3+1⁄2 acres).[9] The dominant building, viewed from the land approach, is the 14th-century keep or tower house. The other principal buildings are the gatehouse; the chapel; and the 16th-century \"palace\" which incorporates the \"Whigs' Vault\".\nDefences\nThe gatehouse (centre) and Benholm's Lodging (left) seen from within the castle\nThe approach to the castle is overlooked by outworks on the \"Fiddle Head\", a promontory on the western side of the headland. The entrance is through the well-defended main gate, set in a curtain wall which entirely blocks a cleft in the rocky cliffs.[60] The gate has a portcullis and has been partly blocked up. Alongside the main gate is the 16th-century Benholm's Lodging, a five-storey building cut into the rock, which incorporated a prison with apartments above.[15] Three tiers of gun ports face outwards from the lower floors of Benholm's Lodging, while inside the main gate, a group of four gun ports face the entrance. The entrance passage then turns sharply to the left, running underground through two tunnels to emerge near the tower house.[9]\nSimpson contends that these defences are \"without exception the strongest in Scotland\",[61] although later writers have doubted the effectiveness of the gun ports. Cruden notes that the alignment of the gun ports in Benholm's Lodging, facing across the approach rather than along, means that they are of limited efficiency.[62] The practicality of the gun ports facing the entrance has also been questioned,[15] though an inventory of 1612 records that four brass cannons were placed here.[63]\nA second access to the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the aperture to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff-top, which in turn offers access to the castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward.[33] A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.[64]\nTower house and surrounding buildings\nThe tower house of Dunnottar, viewed from the west\nThe late 14th-century tower house has a stone-vaulted basement, and originally had three further storeys and a garret above.[4] Measuring 40 by 36 feet (12 by 11 m), the tower house stood 50 feet (15 m) high to its gable.[65] The principal rooms included a great hall and a private chamber for the lord, with bedrooms upstairs.[15] Beside the tower house is a storehouse, and a blacksmith's forge with a large chimney. A stable block is ranged along the southern edge of the headland. Nearby is Waterton's Lodging, also known as the Priest's House, built around 1574,[66] possibly for the use of William Keith (died 1580), son of the 4th Earl Marischal.[15] This small self-contained house includes a hall and kitchen at ground level, with private chambers above, and has a projecting spiral stair on the north side.[66] It is named for Thomas Forbes of Waterton, an attendant of the 7th Earl.[67]\nPalace\nThe palace, from the south-west, with the Silver House in the foreground, and the chapel on the right\nThe palace, to the north-east of the headland, was built in the late 16th century and early to mid-17th century. It comprises three main wings set out around a quadrangle, and for the most part is probably the work of the 5th Earl Marischal who succeeded in 1581.[nb 1] It provided extensive and comfortable accommodation to replace the rooms in the tower house. In its long, low design it has been compared to contemporary English buildings, in contrast to the Scottish tradition of taller towers still prevalent in the 16th century.[68]\nSeven identical lodgings are arranged along the west range, each opening onto the quadrangle and including windows and fireplaces. Above the lodgings of the west range comprised a 120-foot (37 m) gallery. Now roofless, the gallery originally had an elaborate oak ceiling, and on display was a Roman tablet taken from the Antonine Wall.[69][nb 2] At the north end of the gallery was a drawing room linked to the north range. The gallery could also be accessed from the Silver House to the south, which incorporated a broad stairway with a treasury above.[15]\nDunnottar castle viewed from above the entry path\nThe basement of the north range incorporates kitchens and stores, with a dining room and great chamber above. At ground floor level is the Water Gate, between the north and west ranges, which gives access to the postern on the northern cliffs.[70] The east and north ranges are linked via a rectangular stair. The east range has a larder, brewhouse and bakery at ground level, with a suite of apartments for the countess above. A north-east wing contains the Earl's apartments, and includes the \"King's Bedroom\" in which Charles II stayed. In this room is a carved stone inscribed with the arms of the 7th Earl and his wife, and the date 1645. Below these rooms is the Whigs' Vault, a cellar measuring 52 by 15 ft (15.8 by 4.6 m). This cellar, in which the Covenanters were held in 1685, has a large eastern window, as well as a lower vault accessed via a trapdoor in the floor.[71] Of the chambers in the palace, only the dining room and the Silver House remain roofed, having been restored in the 1920s.\nThe central area contains a circular cistern or fish pond, 50 ft (15 m) across and 25 ft (7.6 m) deep,[72] and a bowling green is located to the west.[4] At the south-east corner of the quadrangle is the chapel, consecrated in 1276 and largely rebuilt in the 16th century. Medieval walling and two 13th-century windows remain, and there is a graveyard to the south.[9][15] Dunnottar Castle\nSee also\nDunnottar Parish Church\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAlcock, Leslie; Alcock, Elizabeth A (1992). \"Reconnaissance excavations on Early Historic fortifications and other royal sites in Scotland, 1974–84; 5: A, Excavations & other fieldwork at Forteviot, Perthshire, 1981; B, Excavations at Urquhart Castle, Inverness-shire, 1983; C, Excavations at Dunnottar, Kincardineshire, 1984\" (PDF).

    "text": "Castle on the coast of Banff and Buchan, Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nFindlater Castle.\nclass=notpageimage| Findlater Castle shown within the United Kingdom(grid reference NJ541672)\nFindlater Castle is the old seat of the Earls of Findlater and Seafield, sitting on a 50-foot (15 m)-high cliff overlooking the Moray Firth on the coast of Banff and Buchan, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nLocation and etymology\nIt lies about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Banff, near the village of Sandend, between Cullen and Portsoy. The cliffs here contain quartz; the name \"Findlater\" is derived from the Scots Gaelic words fionn (\"white\") and leitir (\"cliff or steep slope\").\nHistory\nThe first historical reference to the castle is from 1246. King Alexander III of Scotland repaired this castle in the 1260s in preparation for an invasion by King Haakon IV of Norway. The Norwegians took and held the castle for some time. The castle remains that are still there are from the 14th-century rebuilding, when the castle was redesigned based on the Roslyn Castle model.\nJames V of Scotland visited Findlater in November 1535 after a pilgrimage to Tain.[1] The Laird of Findlater, an Ogilvy, was Master of Household to Mary of Guise. He lost his inheritance following sexual misconduct with his mother-in-law and making a plan to imprison his father in a cellar to deprive him of sleep and drive him insane to obtain his lands. After his father's death his mother married John Gordon, a son of the Earl of Huntly, who then took possession of the castle and lands, and promptly imprisoned her.[2]\nJohn Gordon, now of Findlater, fought with Lord Ogilvy in July 1562 and injured his arm.[3] Gordon was imprisoned in Edinburgh until his victim healed, according to custom.[4] In September 1562 Mary, Queen of Scots sent an army equipped with artillery from Dunbar Castle to besiege Findlater, and eject John Gordon of Findlater.[5] When Mary was nearby on 20 September, she had sent her trumpeter messenger to deliver the castle to the captain of her guard, but he was refused.[6] In October 1562 the Earl of Huntly sent Mary the keys of Findlater and Auchindoun, but she was suspicious of the low status of the messenger.[7]\nJames Ogilvy, 1st Earl of Findlater, was given the earldom in 1638. He built the nearby Cullen House to take the place of the castle as the family seat and by the time he died in 1653 it was little used and in decline.\nConservation\nThe castle is a scheduled monument.[8]\nReferences\nExternal links\nFindlater family site\nPortsoy poets site\nTake a 360 Virtual Tour of Findlater Castle\n57°41′32.60″N 2°46′13.47″W / 57.6923889°N 2.7704083°W / 57.6923889; -2.7704083\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nLocation of Fyvie Castle within the former Grampian region\nFyvie Castle - painting by James Giles\nFyvie Castle is a castle in the village of Fyvie, near Turriff in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nHistory\nThe earliest parts of Fyvie Castle date from the 13th century – some sources claim it was built in 1211 by William the Lion. Fyvie was the site of an open-air court held by Robert the Bruce, and Charles I lived there as a child for 4 years. Following the Battle of Otterburn in 1388, it ceased to be a royal stronghold as it was passed to Henry Preston as a reward from Robert iii.[clarification needed]. Instead, it fell into the possession of five successive families – Preston, Meldrum, Seton, Gordon and Forbes-Leith – each of whom added a new tower to the castle. The oldest of these, the Preston Tower (located on the far right as one faces the main facade of Fyvie), dates to between 1390 and 1433. The impressive Seton tower forms the entrance, and was erected in 1599 by Alexander Seton. He commissioned the great wheel staircase several years later. The Gordon Tower followed in 1777, and the Leith in 1890.\nInside, the castle stronghold features a great wheel stair, a display of original arms and armour, and a collection of portraits, from artists such as Henry Raeburn, Pompeo Batoni and Thomas Gainsborough.\nManus O'Cahan and Montrose fought a successful minor battle against the Covenant Army at Fyvie Castle on 28 October 1644. The battlefield was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland in 2011.[1] Anne Halkett stayed at the castle from 1650 to 1652 with the Countess of Dunfermline, she treated wounded soldiers and the illnesses of local people, and negotiated with the English major of a company of Commonwealth soldiers, and with three Colonels, Lilburne, Fitts, and Overton.[2]\nThe grounds and adjoining Fyvie Lake were landscaped in the 18th century by Col. William Gordon. The Scottish industrialist Alexander Leith (later Baron Leith of Fyvie) bought the castle in 1885. His descendants sold it to the National Trust for Scotland in 1984.\nTo the east there is a walled garden where Scottish fruits are currently cultivated.[3] There is evidence for two other walled gardens closer to the castle itself to its west and south.[4] The one to the west appears on an estate plan of 1768.[5]\nGhostlore\nThe castle (like many places in Scotland) has ghostlore associated with it.[6] A story is told that in 1920 during renovation work the skeleton of a woman was discovered behind a bedroom wall. On the day the remains were laid to rest in Fyvie cemetery, the castle residents started to be plagued by strange noises and unexplained happenings. Fearing he had offended the dead woman, the Laird of the castle had the skeleton exhumed and replaced behind the bedroom wall, at which point the haunting ceased. It is said that there is a secret room in the south-west corner of the castle that must remain sealed lest anyone entering meet with disaster.[7] It is unclear if this is the same room in which the skeleton was found. There is also an indelible blood stain, two ghosts and two curses associated with this place.[8]\nOne of the curses has been attributed to the prophetic laird, Thomas the Rhymer. The curse is said to have been part of the mysterious three weeping stones. The curse decrees that until all three stones taken from the castle's boundary marks are brought together, the firstborn sons of the families who live at Fyvie will never inherit the castle. Only one weeping stone is known to exist and is kept at the castle. The other two have never been found, with one built into the castle walls and the other in the depths of the river Ythan. The second curse involves a hidden room in the charter room. The curse is very specific: death to the lord of the castle and blindness to his wife if anyone disturbs it.\nIn the media\nFyvie Castle has featured in a number of British television programmes, such as Living TV's Most Haunted series 6[9] and STV's Castles of Scotland.\nThe castle also played host of the setting of a children's gameshow on CBBC called Spook Squad in 2004.\n2009 saw the publication of the children's fantasy novel, The Time-Tailor and the Fyvie Castle Witch Trials, written by Deborah Leslie. The castle was also featured in the BBC documentary Castle Ghosts of Scotland,[10] narrated by Robert Hardy. In recent years, the castle grounds have hosted a Fyvie Live music festival in the summer, which was headlined in 2011 by Beverley Knight and in 2012 by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, then following a gap of several years, by The Shires in 2017. Following the revival, it was announced that the event would take place again in 2018, with Ward Thomas as the headline act. in August 2024 it also hosted re-enactors from all over the country to bring a re-enactment of the battle of Fyvie 1644.\nToday, the castle is open to tourists between April and October. It is also a wedding venue.\nSide view of the castle\nReferences\nExternal links\nFyvie Castle – National Trust for Scotland\nFyvie Castle Grounds Virtual Tour\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

Before her defeat of the Gordons at the Battle of Corrichie in October 1562, Mary, Queen of Scots stayed here.[1]\nThe castle ruins were demolished in 1975,[1] with the last remains removed by 1982.[2]\nStructure\nThere is no longer any trace of the castle, which had a keep.[1] In 1780 it was reported to Thomas Pennant that the castle was “an old building,.., placed on a small mount, and surrounded with a deep ditch. It is a square tower; one end of it is fallen down, and shews a section of strong vaulted rooms; but there seemed nothing so singular in its structure, as to merit more particular attention”.[2]\nGartly Castle was constructed on a natural mound about 17 metres (56 ft) across and up to 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) high. There was a ditch to the south, east and west.[3]\nCastles in Great Britain and Ireland\nList of castles in Scotland\nReferences\n^ a b c d Coventry, Martin (1997) The Castles of Scotland.

    "text": "Ruined castle in Scotland\nFor HM Castle Huntly, a 15th-century castle west of Dundee that is now used as a prison, see Castle Huntly.\nHuntly Castle is a ruined castle north of Huntly in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where the rivers Deveron and Bogie meet.[1] It was the ancestral home of the chief of Clan Gordon, Earl of Huntly. There have been four castles built on the site that have been referred to as Huntly Castle, Strathbogie Castle or Peel of Strathbogie.[1][2]\nLocation\nHuntly Castle was built on the crossing of the rivers Deveron and Bogie, north of Huntly and roughly 40 miles from Aberdeen. The original wooden castle was built on a motte. The second castle, made of stone, was built on the northern end of the bailey. The third and modern castles were built to the east of the original, at the southern end of the estate.[2]\nHistory\nThe castle was originally built by Duncan II, Earl of Fife, on the Strathbogie estate sometime around 1180 and 1190.[2][1] The castle became known as the Peel of Strathbogie.[3]\nThe Earl Duncan's third son, David, inherited the Strathbogie estate and later, through marriage, became earls of Atholl around 1204.[1] During the Strathbogie family's time at the estate, Robert the Bruce was a guest after falling ill at Inverurie. The family was loyal to him and when he got better, Robert the Bruce went on to win the battle of Bannockburn.[3] However, around 1314, David of Strathbogie shifted his support to the English right before Robert the Bruce won the battle of Bannockburn. Robert the Bruce saw this as treachery and granted the castle and estate to Sir Adam Gordon of Huntly because he was consistently loyal. In 1506, the castle was officially renamed Huntly Castle.[2]\nReign of James IV\nAlthough the castle was burned to the ground, a grander castle was built in its place. In 1496, the pretender to the English throne, Perkin Warbeck, was married to Lady Catherine Gordon the daughter of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, witnessed by King James IV of Scotland at Edinburgh. James IV came to Huntly in October 1501 and gave gifts of money to the stonemasons working on the castle. In October 1503, James IV came again and played in a shooting contest at a target called a \"prop\".[4] He came back again in the following October, on his way south, accompanied by four Italian minstrels and an African drummer known as the \"More taubronar\".[5] James IV played cards at the castle on 10 October 1505 and gave a tip to masons working on the building. These visits were part of his annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Duthac at Tain.[6] Architecturally the L plan castle consists of a well-preserved five-story tower with an adjoining great hall and supporting buildings. Areas of the original ornate facade and interior stonework remain. Wings were added to the castle in the 16th and 17th centuries.\nCarved inscriptions feature on the facade\nReign of Mary, Queen of Scots\nWilliam Mackintosh was executed on 23 August 1550 at \"Castle Strathbogie\", as a conspirator against the Earl of Huntly, the queen's lieutenant in the North.[7]\nThe English diplomat Thomas Randolph stayed two nights in September 1562,[8] and wrote that the castle was \"fayer, beste furnishede of anye howse that I have seen in thys countrie.\"[9] Mary, Queen of Scots decided to take the castle, giving as a cause that the Earl withheld from her a royal cannon lent to him by Regent Arran.[10] She sent her half-brother John Stewart, Commendator of Coldingham to arrest the George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly at Huntly Castle in October 1562. On the day William Kirkcaldy of Grange and the Tutor of Pitcur arrived first and surrounded the house. While Kirkcaldy was talking to the castle porter, the castle watchman on the tower spotted Coldingham and the Master of Lindsay and their troops a mile off. He alerted the Earl, who ran without \"boot or sword\" and hopped over a low wall at the back of the castle and found a horse before Pitcur could stop him. Elizabeth Keith, Countess of Huntly then welcomed the queen's men and gave them a meal and showed them around the place. She still had her chapel furnished for Roman Catholic worship.[11]\nGeorge Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly died after the Battle of Corrichie on 28 October 1562, and the castle was garrisoned for Mary, Queen of Scots by Charles Crawfurd and twenty soldiers. Furnishings including beds and 45 tapestries were carted to Aberdeen and shipped in barrels to Edinburgh for the royal collection and refurbishment by Servais de Condé.[12] After the surrender of Mary, Queen of Scots, at the battle of Carberry Hill, the Earl of Bothwell came north to meet George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly at \"Stawboggye\", and moved on to Spynie Castle after Huntly deserted his cause.[13] In July 1570 the exiled Earl of Westmorland found refuge at Huntly.[14]\nJohn Gordon, Earl of Sutheerland\nJohn Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland and his wife Marion Seton were poisoned at Helmsdale Castle in 1567 by Isobel Sinclair, the wife of Gordon of Gartly.[15] Isobel Seton's own son also died, but the fifteen-year-old heir of Sutherland, Alexander Gordon was unharmed. He was made to marry the Earl of Caithness' daughter Barbara Sinclair. In 1569 he escaped from the Sinclairs to Huntly Castle and remained at Huntly until he came of age in 1573. Barbara Sinclair died, and Alexander Gordon, now Earl of Sutherland, married Jean Gordon, former wife of the Earl of Bothwell, who had also found a refuge at Huntly Castle.[16]\nA fatal football match\nAn early description of the death of George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly in 1576, compiled by Richard Bannatyne gives some details of how the castle was used.[17] The Earl suffered a stroke, or a collapse caused by food poisoning, while playing football outside the Castle on the Green. He was taken through the outer gate to his bedchamber in the round tower of the palace block, which was then called the \"New Warke of Strathbogie.\" The Earl's bedchamber was adjacent to his \"Grit Chalmer\", the Great Chamber. After the Earl died, his body was laid out in the \"Chamber of Dais\", another name for the Great Chamber, and his valuables were secured in the bedchamber. After the Earl's steward left the castle, a number of alleged supernatural events occurred beginning with the sudden collapse of one of the servants in the \"Laich Chalmer\", Low Chamber. This \"Laich Chalmer\" was in another part of the castle, under a stair opposite the \"Auld Hall.\" On the following day, a servant went up to the Gallery at the top of the \"New Warke\" where spices (which were precious) were stored. This servant and two companions also collapsed and when revived complained of feeling cold. After the Earl's body was embalmed and taken to the chapel, his brother sat on a bench in the Hall by the Great Chamber door, and heard unexplained sounds from the chamber. It was said that \"there is not a live thing bigger than a mouse may enter in that chamber with the door locked.\"[18]\nEngraving of the castle by James Fittler in Scotia Depicta, published 1804\nRear courtyard ruins of Huntly Castle\nJames VI slights the castle\nIn March 1584 an English recusant Catholic Sir Thomas Gerard of Bryn was sent by Lady Ferniehirst to find refuge at Huntly.[19] George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly was a Catholic and James VI decided to subdue his power in the north. The king arrived at Huntly on 26 April 1589 after spending a night at Kintore. The Earl of Huntly had fled to the mountains, stripping the countryside and emptying the house of furniture. James brought 100 workmen to demolish the castle. Huntly sent the king an offer to spare the house and surrendered.[20]\nIn March 1593 a royal garrison of 16 men commanded by Archie Carmichael was to be put in Huntly Castle.[21] In May 1593 the Earl captured a man called Pedder in the lands of Atholl. Pedder was hanged and dismembered and his body parts displayed on poles at Huntly.[22]\nIn July 1594 Huntly was overseeing the building of a new hall and gallery.[23] Following the battle of Glenlivet, James VI came with workmen again and his master of works William Schaw, and planned to blow up the \"gret old tower\" which had been \"fourteen years in building\" on 29 October 1594.[24] The kirk minister Andrew Melville was with the king and a vocal advocate for demolition.[25] Aberdeen town council bought twenty stones in weight of gunpowder for the demolition of Huntly and other places,[26] and sent the stonemason John Fraser and other workmen to the demolition work at Huntly and Old Slains Castle, equipped with new shovels.[27]\nThe royal council met at Terrisoule to discuss the planned demolition on 28 October. Some Lords wanted the fortress kept to hold a loyal garrison. James VI still wished the whole castle, the new and old work, to be slighted.[28] It was decided not to completely demolish Huntly and Slains Castle and other houses, but preserve them for the convenience of the royal garrisons. It was also said that the pleas of the Countesses of Huntly and Erroll to save the houses were successful.[29] David Foulis wrote to Anthony Bacon that Henrietta Stewart, Countess of Huntly, watched the demolition at Huntly and was not allowed to have an audience with the king to plead her case.[30] The king made his friend Sir John Gordon of Pitlurg the keeper of the remaining buildings at Huntly.[31]\nRestored for a Marquess\nThe Marquess of Huntly restored and rebuilt the castle.[32] In 1746, an English soldier, James Ray, saw the ruins and commented on ceilings, still decorated with \"history-painting\".[33]\nHuntly spent large sums restoring and enlarging the castle in April 1597.[34] The restored facade of the main block was carved with the names and titles of the marquess, \"George Gordon\" and his wife, \"Henrietta Stewart\" who was a favourite of the queen, Anne of Denmark.[35] In February 1603 James VI made plans to resolve the Marquess's feuds including a royal visit to Huntly with Anne of Denmark and the Earl of Moray later in the year. The visit did not take place because of the death of Elizabeth I and the subsequent Union of the Crowns.[36]\nIn 1640 the Castle was occupied by the Scottish Covenanter army under Major-General Robert Monro (d. 1680). James Gordon Parson of Rothiemay tells us how the house \"was preserved from being rifled or defaced, except some emblems and imagery, which looked somewhat popish and superstitious lycke; and therefore, by the industry of one captain James Wallace (one of Munro's foote captaines) were hewd and brocke doune off the frontispiece of the house; but all the rest of the frontispiece containing Huntly's scutcheon, etc, was left untouched, as it stands to this daye.\"\nCaptured in October 1644, the castle was briefly held by James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose against the Duke of Argyll. In 1647 it was gallantly defended against General David Leslie by Lord Charles Gordon, but its 'Irish' garrison was starved into surrender. Savage treatment was meted out, for the men were hanged and their officers beheaded. In December of the same year the Marquess of Huntly himself was captured and on his way to execution at Edinburgh was detained, by a refinement of cruelty, in his own mansion. His escort was shot against its walls.\nAn inventory made by the garrison shows the state rooms were still fully furnished, including the earl's 'chapel bed'.[37] In 1650 Charles II visited briefly on his way to the Battle of Worcester, defeat and exile. The Civil War brought an end to the Gordon of Huntly family's long occupation of the castle.\nIn 1689, during the first Jacobite rising, the castle was briefly the headquarters for Viscount Dundee and his Jacobite army, at the end of April, just after the start of the revolt. However, by the early eighteenth century the castle was already in decay and providing material for predatory house builders in the village. In 1746, during a later Jacobite rising, it was occupied by British government troops. Thereafter, it became a common quarry until a groundswell of antiquarian sentiment in the 19th century came to the rescue of the noble pile.\nHuntly Castle remained under the ownership of the Clan Gordon until 1923. Today, the remains of the castle are cared for by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.[38]\nPure Strength I, a major international strongman competition, was held on the grounds of Huntly Castle in 1987. The winner of the contest was Jón Páll Sigmarsson of Iceland.[39]\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"History\". www.historicenvironment.scot.

    "text": "Ruined castle in Kildrummy, Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nKildrummy Castle is a ruined castle near Kildrummy, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Though ruined, it is one of the most extensive castles dating from the 13th century to survive in eastern Scotland, and was the seat of the Earls of Mar. It is owned today by Historic Environment Scotland and is open to the public as a scheduled ancient monument[1] with gardens that are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.[2]\nHistory\nThe castle was probably built in the mid-13th century under Gilbert de Moravia. It has been posited that siting of Kildrummy Castle was influenced by the location of the Grampian Mounth trackway crossings, particularly the Elsick Mounth and Cryne Corse Mounth.[3] Kildrummy Castle underwent siege numerous times in its history, first in defence of the family of Robert the Bruce in August–September 1306 (leading to the executions of Nigel Bruce and many other Scots),[4] and again in 1335 by David of Strathbogie. On this occasion Christina Bruce held off the attackers until her husband Sir Andrew Murray came to her rescue.[5] In the reign of David II, Walter Maule of Panmure was warden of Kildrummy Castle.[6]\nIn 1403-4 Alexander Stewart, murdered Sir Malcolm Drummond and then took his widow, Isabel Douglas, Countess of Mar, by force and laid claim to Kildrummy and the title of \"Earl of Mar\". In 1435 it was taken over by James I and became a royal castle. In 1468 Henry Kinghorn was keeper of Kildrummy Castle for James III and spent £100 Scots on building works and repairs.[7] James IV granted the keeping of Kildrummy and its lands to Alexander Elphinstone, 1st Lord Elphinstone and his wife Elizabeth Barlow in 1507.[8]\nThe castle passed from the Clan Elphinstone to the Clan Erskine before being abandoned in 1716 following the failure of the Jacobite Rising of 1715.\nIn 1538 the castle was raided by John Strachan, the young laird of Lenturk, who took furnishings and fixtures. Strachan brought a blacksmith to remove the ironwork from the windows and doors. Some of the metal was turned into horseshoes and used to mend ploughs at the Kirktoun of Glenbuchat.[9]\nIn May 1585 Margaret Haldane, the wife of David Erskine, Commendator of Dryburgh, was held at Kildrummy in the custody of the Master of Elphinstone.[10] In 1645 Robert Farquharson of Invercauld was the keeper of Kildrummy Castle for the Earl of Mar and his son Lord Erskine. The laird of Glenkindie also helped to keep the castle, fearing the depredations that a garrison of outsider or \"stranger\" soldiers would make on his lands.[11]\nArchitecture\nKildrummy Castle is \"shield-shaped\" in plan with a number of independent towers. The flat side of the castle overlooks a steep ravine; moreover, on the opposite side of the castle the walls come to a point, which was once defended by a massive twin-towered gatehouse. The castle also had a keep, called the Snow Tower, taller than the other towers, built in the French style, as at Bothwell Castle. Extensive earthworks protected the castle, including a dry moat and the ravine. Most of the castle foundations are now visible, along with most of its lower-storey walls.

    "text": "Historic baronial fortress\nLauriston Castle stands on a clifftop site near the Aberdeenshire village of St Cyrus and just over a mile inland from the North Sea coast of Scotland. Once a royal fortress, it can claim to be one of the oldest privately owned and inhabited castles in the region. It is a Category C listed building.[1]\nHistory\n9th century\nBy tradition, it was the stronghold of Giric, Grig or Gregory the Great, one of the last of the Pictish kings (AD 878–889). The site of his church of Ecclesgreig (Eglise Grig) is nearby and he gave his Latin name, Ciricius, to St. Cyrus.[2]\n13th – 17th centuries\nLauriston’s first charter is dated 1243 and it soon developed into a classic courtyard castle which was savagely fought over during Scotland's Wars of Independence and strengthened by King Edward III in 1336 as part of the chain of strongholds which he hoped would prevent a French landing in support of the Scots.\nOne of the corner towers on the edge of the cliff was incorporated into a typical laird’s house in the 1500s. In turn, this house was absorbed into a very large Georgian mansion of Palladian design, dated 1765–89.\nFor nearly 450 years Lauriston was held by the Stratons, whose arms of 1292 are among the earliest recorded in Scotland.[3] The eloquent Declaration of Arbroath, the famous letter of 1320 to Pope John XXII, sealed by the nation’s earls and barons, has as its final signatory the name of Alexander Straton.\nAnother Straton, the “noble knicht o’ Lauriston”, fell at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, and shortly afterwards his son was involved in the affair of the Sheriff’s Kettle. The barons of the Mearns had been complaining about the high-handed behaviour of John Melville of Glenbervie, Sheriff of Kincardineshire, and King James’s Regent, the Duke of Albany, exclaimed in exasperation that he would not mind if they \"biled the loon and suppit the bree\". Taking this as royal licence, a group of barons lured Melville to a hunting party, tipped him into a cauldron or kettle of boiling water and, to seal the conspiracy, supped the broth.[4]\nThe Stratons continued, however, to prosper at Lauriston, even surviving the events of 1534, when David Straton fell out with the Church over payment of tithes on the salmon fishery. He objected to giving every tenth fish to the Abbot of Arbroath and told “his servants to cast the tenth fish into the sea againe\", saying that God could catch his own. For this evasion of Church taxes he was taken to Edinburgh and condemned to death, thus becoming one of Scotland's first Protestant martyrs.[5]\n17th – 18th centuries\nIn 1695, the Stratons were forced to sell Lauriston. Under the charter to the new owner, Court of Session Judge, Sir James Falconer of Phesdo, the estate became a burgh of barony, with a freeport at Miltonhaven.[6][7] The name of the barony was also changed to Miltonhaven, but storms in the 1790s swept away both the port and village, leaving Lauriston to be known as “The Drown’d Barony”. Over the following century, the policies were developed in fashionable Picturesque style, with waterfalls, walks and a two-acre walled garden.\n20th century\nFollowing its use as RAF barracks during World War II, part of the mansion was demolished, and according to Nigel Tranter, the castle had “fallen on evil days indeed”.[8][9]\nLauriston's Great Hall and Doocot Tower were rebuilt in the late 1980s by William and Dorothy Newlands of Lauriston to plans drawn up by architect Ian Begg.[10] The doocot received a Glenfiddich Living Scotland Award in 1992.\nLady Lauriston is chair of the Scottish Castles Association.\nReferences\n56°47′23″N 2°23′44″W / 56.7896°N 2.3955°W / 56.7896; -2.3955\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Old medieval Scottish castle\nFor Craighall Castle, the castle of Clan Rattray, see Blairgowrie and Rattray.\nCastle Hill in 2008, all that is left of the original site\nRattray Castle, one of the nine castles of the Knuckle The Castle of Rattray was a medieval Scottish castle, with multiple variations on its structure over approximately six centuries. Originally built as a \"late 12th- or early 13th century defensive motte\"[1] it provided protection for Starny Keppie Harbour and Rattray village. Sometime between 1214 and 1233 it was upgraded by William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan before being destroyed in the 1308 Harrying of Buchan. After Comyn's timber castle was burned down, it was replaced by a stronger stone castle which was engulfed during a 1720 sand storm along with nearby Rattray village. After the storm, the castle was not dug out and remains covered to this day. The castle was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of north-east Aberdeenshire.[2]\nLocation\nThe castle was sited on Castlehill, on the south bank of the now-closed estuary flowing into Strathbeg Bay- the north bank was protected by the opposite Lonmay Castle.[3] Specifically the castle was \"beside an inlet which led from the sea into a sheltered harbour\"[4] on \"the harbour side\" of Rattray village.[3] The later stone castle is known to have had a \"harbour-side entrance\".[5]\nOriginally situated on \"a rock near the sea\",[6][7] Castlehill is today about 1 mile inland as shifting sands have significantly altered the shape of the coast. Located to the south of Loch Strathbeg it can be seen as a grassy \"circular mound\"[8] which is \"oval & natural with its top slightly dished\".[5] A 1791 book states it has a \"summit\"... [of] \"half a Scots acre\"[9] (approx. 0.25 hectare) and \"rises 38 feet\"... (11.6 metres) \"above a small plain on the\"... north-east \"but is only 12 or 14 feet\"... (3.7 or 4.3 metres) \"above the higher ground\"[10] to the south-west.\nHistory\n1100 AD to 1200\nThe first construction of Castlehill was a small keep during the late middle ages, or a 12th century \"timber castle or Motte\"[4] built to protect the estuary.\nComyn period (1200 to 1308)\nIn the 13th century, the Castle of Rattray was \"the principal seat of the Cummings\"... [alt. spelling of Comyn] \"Earls of Buchan\"[11] who arrived at the start of that century. Between 1214 when he inherited the Earldom of Buchan and his own death in 1233, William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan[7][8] built upon the motte but it is unclear whether he upgraded the existing buildings or built an entirely new castle. He is known to have completed a \"manor house\"[4] with \"a fine timber-framed hall\"[4] (the castle) which was accompanied by the private St Mary's Chapel which he constructed \"a quarter of a mile\"[10] (0.4 kilometres) south, in Rattray village itself.\nIn the mid-1270s, it is reported that \"a castle-strengthening programme Rattray\"[12] took place.\nComyn's castle survived until the Harrying of Buchan in the summer of 1308,[6] when all the Comyn lands were bloodily burned to the ground after John Comyn, Earl of Buchan was beaten at the Battle of Barra. The timber Rattray Castle was almost certainly attacked by Robert the Bruce or his younger brother Edward after which the \"castle fell into ruins\"[10] if not burned to the ground.\n1308 to ~1720\nFollowing the harrying, the site of Rattray's timber castle was rebuilt with a \"stone-built hall\".[4] This stone incarnation provided protection for Starnie Keppie Harbour and the village of Rattray, as the previous incarnations did.\nThe Earldom of Buchan and hence the castle was inherited and divided after the harrying between John Comyn's two nieces.[13] Henry de Beaumont, the husband of one niece; Alice Comyn, claimed the title under her name but was disinherited from the lands in 1314. A 1324 charter from Robert the Bruce then gives the \"lordship of Rattray\" to Sir Archibald Douglas.[14] The lands again change hands in 1382 when Alexander Stewart was given the Earldom by his father Robert II of Scotland.\nMary, Queen of Scots, declared Rattray a Royal Burgh in 1563 \"to put an end to the disputes about superiority over it between William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal and George Hay, 7th Earl of Erroll\".[7] The importance of the Burgh is questionable due to the fact \"it does not appear to have long enjoyed that privilege not being ranked in the roll of boroughs for many ages\" [15] and as it was \"said to have had all the privileges of a royal borough, except sending members to parliament.\"[16]\nIn later years Rattray was run by a feudal system of superiors who maintained the land for the Crown, some of whom are known due to charters that they granted. \"David Rivis\"... \"superior of the lands of Rattray\"[17] granted a charter in 1617; \"William Watson of Haddo, bailie of the burgh of Rattray, superior\"[17] [of Rattray] granted a charter in 1675 and \"Charles\".. [Hay, 13th] \"Earl of Erroll, superior of the lands of Rattray\"[17] granted a charter in 1711.\nThe destruction of the stone castle and the nearby village of Rattray, is said by \"a tradition\"[7] to have happened during the great storm of 1720[18] which cut off Strathbeg Bay. It is believed that the castle was \"blown over with sand one Sunday evening while the\"[7] inhabitants, \"a godless crew\".[18] \"were engaged in playing cards\".[7] \"on the Sabbath, [when] they were buried alive.\"[18]\nAnother story says that the site was \"buried because of the plague.\"[7] However there is no date or record of which plague and it is a very unlikely account.\n~1720 to 1988\nToday there is not much to be seen at the site as the remains have \"for a long period [been] covered with a deep soil, and now- the swords of the warlike house beaten literally into ploughshares\".[19] In c. 1730, a dig at the south-east \"side of the Castle Hill\"... \"found a great number of stones, supposed to belong to the kitchen of the castle, as\"... \"workmen found very large hearthstones covered with ashes.\"[20]\nItems recovered include; \"a quantity of regularly-laid stones were removed c. 1734 and some silver coins\"[5] as well as two kilns stands found in 1829 (today held in Marischal Museum, Aberdeen).[21]\nIn 1740 \"a man who drove his spade through the panel of a door was immediately suffocated\"[7] having got caught in the sand and at an unknown date, a \"well-made causeway was discovered at the foot of the mound under which the Castle is said to be buried.\"[7]\n1985-1989 Excavations\nThorough excavations at Castlehill in 1985-1989 revealed the remains of the stone castle and traces of the previous timber one.[5] Traces of the stone castle revealed a \"perimeter wall\".. and \"two mural buildings\".[5] It also ascertained that the later stone castle was approximately \"20m by 6.5 m\"[5] and \"divided into three parts, a central room, and two smaller end rooms\".[5] It likely supported more than one storey, due to the \"indication of a possible forestair\"... and \"the wall thickness.\"[5]\nThe results of this excavation can be found in the Journal article (available free from the link in the journal citation below) \"Excavations at Rattray, Aberdeenshire.

    "text": "Historic site\nSlains Castle (otherwise known as Old Slains Castle) is a ruined castle near Collieston in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is not to be confused with New Slains Castle, a separate building located five miles (eight kilometres) northeast. Built in the 13th century, it was partly destroyed in 1594.\nHistory\nThe 13th-century castle was originally the property of the Comyn, Earl of Buchan. After the forfeiture of the Comyns in the 14th century it was given to Sir Gilbert Hay by Robert the Bruce in recognition for his support against the English.[1]\nSlains Castle next comes into prominence when Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll took part in a Catholic Rebellion in the north of Scotland. King James VI came to Abedeen in April 1589 and placed a garrison of soldiers at Slains Castle.[2] In January 1593, the Earl of Erroll was said to have welcomed so many English and Scottish Catholics in a tower at Slains that he was put to great expense.[3] The rebellion culminated in the Battle of Glenlivet in 1594, which left the Catholic army substantially weakened, and the rebellion collapsed. James VI marched north with an army intent on capturing the leaders of the rebellion, including Francis Hay, however they evaded capture.[4] He then proceeded to blow up their castles, including Old Slains Castle. At the king's request, Aberdeen Council provided 20 stone (130 kilograms) weight of gunpowder together with pickaxes and other tools, required for ‘demolishing and casting down of houses and fortalices to the sum of 548 pounds six shillings’.[5] The castle was destroyed with gunpowder and cannon on 1 November.[6] Aberdeen town council sent the stonemason John Fraser and other workmen to the demolition work at Huntly Castle and Slains, equipped with new shovels.[7] Two walls meeting at a corner survived the explosion. (Old) Slains Castle. What remains after it was blown up with gunpowder in 1594. Next year, Elizabeth Douglas, Countess of Erroll, a friend of Anne of Denmark, hired masons to repair the building.[8] However, it was beyond saving. She then moved into the farmhouse of Clochtow, 1⁄2 mile (800 metres) northwest of the ruined castle. She remained in this ‘mean abode, and continued there sometime after 1597, when the honours and estates were restored... The Countess, all her remaining days, preferred to her noble title of Countess of Erroll the plain designation of “Guidwife of Clochtow”, because this designation had never been taken by the crown from her, and she had been known by it during the period of her husband’s exile, when he was a wanderer abroad, and only plain “Francis Hay”.’[9] Francis Hay later built a tower house called Bowness on what is now the site of New Slains Castle.[10]\nStructure\nOriginally a strongly built 5-storey oblong keep (of which a small part remains), a wall defending the landward side was added in the early 16th century.\nModern day\nTwo sections of wall remain standing, at approximately 25 metres (82 ft) in height. The south-facing wall partially collapsed on 31 May 1979. An estimated 100 tons of rubble fell on the road next to the castle, blocking the road and partially burying a lorry.[11] In the 1950s, a 3-storey house was built within the ruins, adjoining a fishing cottage built in the 18th century. Since 1991 several archaeological excavations have been carried out, the last one in 2007.[1][citation needed] The remains of the old castle are designated as a scheduled ancient monument.[1]\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAitken, Margaret.

King Robert I of Scotland captured the castle in 1306 and burned it. The castle rebuilt by the English and was in English hands when Scots, led by Philp the Forester of Platan, recaptured it on Christmas Day, 1308, and slaughtered the garrison. After demolition and rebuilding in 1308, the castle was destroyed again in 1313 and was abandoned by the 1330s.[2]\nNo trace of the castle remains above ground, although there were remains up to the 17th century.[2]\nReferences\n^ a b \"Royal Forfarr\".

    "text": "Former castle near Helensburgh\nArdencaple Castle, also known as Ardincaple Castle, and sometimes referred to as Ardencaple Castle Light, is a listed building, situated about 1 statute mile (1.6 km) from Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, Scotland.[2][3] Today, all that remains of the castle is a tower, perched on the edge of a plateau, looking down on a flat tract of land between it and the shore of the Firth of Clyde.[4] The original castle was thought to have been built sometime in the 12th century,[5] and part of the remains of the original castle were said to have existed in the 19th century.[2] Today, that sole remaining tower is used as a navigational aid for shipping on the Firth of Clyde. Because of its use as a lighthouse the tower has been called Ardencaple Castle Light.[6]\nLairds of Ardincaple\nThe word Ardencaple or Ardincaple has been said to be derived from the Gaelic Ard na gCapull, meaning \"cape of the horses\", or \"of the mares\", or \"height of the horses\".[7][8] In 1351 this place name was recorded as Airdendgappil.[7] From the Middle Ages the lands of Ardencaple were controlled by the Lairds of Ardincaple. By the late 15th century or 16th century the lairds had adopted the surname MacAulay. By this time the Laird of Ardincaple was considered the clan chief of Clan MacAulay.\nThe fortunes of the Lairds of Ardincaple failed in the 18th century, and they were forced to divide and sell, piece by piece, the lands of Ardincaple and their other estates to pay debts. Archibald MacAulay, 9th laird (died 1752), began the process around 1700,[9] and the sales continued under his sons - one of whom wrote a primer on shorthand in an effort to raise money.[10] By the time the 12th laird died around 1767, the roof had fallen in and the overall condition of the castle had deteriorated to such an extent that he had been forced to abandon his residence there and live in nearby Laggarie, having completed the sale of the MacAulay estates.[9]\nRenovations to the Ardincaple Estate\nSketch by Robert Adam of his planned addition to Ardincaple Castle in 1774.\nThe estate was then purchased by John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll,[11] and remained in possession of the Campbells well into the 19th century. It was during the Campbell's tenure as lairds of Ardencaple in the 18th century that extensive development was done on the estate by Robert Adam - Scotland's foremost architect of the time. In 1764, while the house was in possession of Lord Frederick Campbell, Robert Adam was first consulted about work on the castle. The house was then irregularly shaped, and Adam came up with a plan for the addition of castle-style additions on the western side of the house which faced the Gare Loch. However, nothing came of this scheme and it wasn't until 1774 that Adam came up with a set of drawings for an addition to the southern half of the west front of the house. This addition was made up of three-bay-windowed, D-shaped tower set in between two smaller turrets (pictured left). Later photographs of Ardincaple Castle show that Adam's extension had been altered or that some features present in his sketch were omitted from being implemented. For instance, the conical roofs, the crow-stepped gable in the sketch do not appear in photographs of the castle. Photographs of Ardincaple Castle show that the tower and southern turret had one more storey than appear in Adam's sketch According to David King, it is possible that Adam was responsible for the added extra floor to the tower, but that is it very unlikely Adam altered the turret because the altered turret broke the symmetry of the addition. Also, Adam had planned that the tower would contain a D-shaped dressing room on its main floor (upper floor). However, it was later decided to make the room oval shaped. David King remarks that Adam had planned a pleasant ceiling for this room, but that there is no sign of it in photographs of 1957.[12] George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll was born at Ardencaple Castle on 30 April 1823.[13] By 1852 the Duchess Dowager of Argyll sold the Ardencaple estate to the wealthy Colquhouns of Luss.[14] Ardencaple Castle Light. Today the tower is used as a navigational aid for shipping on the Firth of Clyde. Photo by Robie Macauley.\nModern era and destruction of the castle\nIn 1923, Sir Iain Colquhoun sold the castle to Mrs. H. Macaulay-Stromberg,[15] a wealthy American, who restored the castle and lived there until her death, in 1931.[16] The castle then passed to Adelaide Parker Voorheis until 1935,[16] when it passed to a consortium of developers who had constructed, in 1936-1937 a housing estate on what used to be the Tower Lawn.[16] The castle then was requisitioned by the Royal Navy[16] with the outbreak of World War II.\nIn 1957 most of the castle was demolished by the government in order to build naval housing for the nearby HMNB Clyde (Faslane Naval Base & Royal Naval Armaments Depot, Coulport), though one tower was left to be used as a mount for navigational beacons and transit lights for the Royal Navy.[17] From then on, the 45-foot (14 m) high tower was known as \"Ardencaple Castle Range Rear Light\", and had two green lights mounted on its south-west corner.[1] Ardencaple Castle has been considered a Category B listed building since 14 May 1971.[3] Today, all that remains of the grand turreted mansion is one solitary tower.\nGallery\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Ardencaple Castle.

    "text": "Aros Castle, also known as Dounarwyse Castle, is a ruined 13th-century castle near Salen on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. The castle overlooks the Sound of Mull.\nHistory\nThe castle was probably built by one of the MacDougall lords of Lorn in the 13th century. Documentary evidence from the late 14th century records it as Dounarwyse Castle in the possession of the Lords of the Isles. The castle was initially a stronghold of the Clan MacDougall. When they backed the losing side in the dispute between Edward I and Robert de Bruys, their lands were declared forfeit and the castle was given by King Robert to Angus Og of Islay Lord of the Isles and Clan Donald. During the late 14th and 15th centuries, it was used as an occasional base by the Lords of the Isles, at which time it was known as Dounarwyse Castle. When, some centuries later, the latter tried to conquer Scotland, they too had their lands declared forfeit, and this time Clan Maclean gained the Castle at MacDonald expense.\nLord Ochiltree entertained the Island Chiefs here in 1608 before making them prisoners. It was described as 'ruinous, old, useless and never of any strength' in 1688 but seems to have been garrisoned by Argyll's troops in 1690. No evidence exists of any occupation in the 18th century or later.\nStatus\nIt is a scheduled monument that includes the 13th-century hall-house and bailey with traces of other buildings, possibly of a later date, and a small stone-built galley landing east of the bailey.[1] References\nRoyal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland listing - Aros Castle, CANMORE\nMike Salter, Castles of Western and Northern Scotland 1995\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",
