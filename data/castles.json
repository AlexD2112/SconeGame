    "text": "Castle in Aberdeen, Scotland\nAberdeen Castle was a late Middle Ages fortification,[1] in Aberdeen, Scotland.[2] It was situated on Castle Hill, a site today known as the Castlegate, and the location of the castle is now occupied by blocks of flats.[3]\nBurned and demolished\nIt is thought the castle and fortifications were slighted[4] by King Robert the Bruce as was his policy on recaptured castles in June 1308, during the Wars of Scottish Independence immediately following the Harrying of Buchan. Bruce and his men laid siege to the castle before massacring the English Garrison to prevent its use by the English troops of Edward II. It is said the Scots showed no mercy but \"slew every man who fell into their hands. Edward I, indeed, had already set the example of executing his prisoners. It was not to be expected that the other side would fail to follow the same course\"[5] However, as of August 1308, Gilbert Pecche and the last troops were allowed to leave Aberdeen; this obviously cannot be accurate.[1] On 10 July 1308, English ships left Hartlepool to help the English garrison.[6] Legend tells that the city's motto, Bon Accord, came from the password used to initiate Bruce's final push and destruction of the castle.[7][8]\nSurrender to the English\nThe castle was surrendered to the English in 1295, and on 14 April 1296, the English King, Edward I arrived in Aberdeen and stayed in the castle as part of his suppression of the east coast of Scotland, having defeated the Scots.[9]\nWallace\nHowever, the following year, after defeating the English at Dunnottar Castle in 1297, William Wallace marched his men to Aberdeen during their campaign to retake the east coast for the Scots.\nThey found the English hastily preparing to leave in an armada of one hundred ships. The speed of Wallace's arrival from Dunottar caught the English unawares, and at low tide, the stranded ships were attacked in the harbour, the crew and soldiers slaughtered, the cargo taken, and the ships burnt.\nJohn Balliol\nThe English Sheriff of Aberdeen, Sir Henry de Lazom had been left in charge of the Castle, but during the chaos of the attack, he defected, declaring it in the name of the Scottish King, John Balliol.[10][11]\nReferences\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle and museum in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, UK\nDelgatie Castle is a castle near Turriff, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nA castle has stood on the site of Delgatie Castle since the year 1030 AD, although the earliest parts of the castle standing today were built between 1570 and 1579.[1] Additional wings and a chapel were added in 1743.\nThe castle was stripped from the disgraced Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, after the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and given to Clan Hay (later to become the Earls of Erroll). Mary, Queen of Scots, was a guest at the castle in 1562 after the Battle of Corrichie.[2]\nLike many castles, Delgatie is rumoured to be haunted. A number of reports of a ghostly red-haired figure, supposedly one Alexander Hay, were made by soldiers posted there during the Second World War. The castle's information boards, mostly written by Captain Hay who restored the house in the 1950s, recount that the ghost was first seen when a body was found bricked up in a priest hole.\nArchitecturally, the castle consists of a keep, adjoining house and two later wings. Notable features include a very wide turnpike stair and painted ceilings dating from the 16th century in two of the rooms, one dating from 1592, and the other from 1597.[3] In many places may be seen the Hay family arms including the three cattle yokes which recall a farmer and his two sons who were instrumental in the defeat of a Danish raiding party at Cruden Bay. (See Clan Hay for more detail.)\nToday, the castle and its gardens are owned by the Delgatie Castle Trust. The castle, grounds and café are open to the public throughout the summer months and suites within the castle itself and a number of cottages on the estate are available to rent. There is also a popular fishing site on the river passing through.\nGallery Delgatie Castle in 2017 Painted ceiling in Delgatie Castle\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Delgatie Castle.\nDelgatie Castle website\nReferences\n57°32′39″N 2°24′43″W / 57.5443°N 2.4120°W / 57.5443; -2.4120\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_Castle",
    "text": "Tower house in Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nDrum Castle is a castle near Drumoak in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. For centuries it was the seat of the chief of Clan Irvine.[1] The place-name Drum is derived from Gaelic druim, 'ridge'.[2] The site is located approximately 6+1⁄2 miles (10.5 kilometres) northeast of Banchory and 3 miles (5 kilometres) west of Peterculter. The property is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland and is open to the public.\nHistory\nThe original 13th-century tower of Drum Castle has been suggested as the work of medieval architect Richard Cementarius, who built the Brig o' Balgownie, the first Bridge of Don, in Old Aberdeen. It is believed to be one of the three oldest tower houses in Scotland (and notably unaltered). A large wing was added in 1619 by the 9th laird, and further alterations were made during the Victorian era.\nThe castle and its grounds were granted to William de Irwyn in 1323 by Robert the Bruce, and remained in the possession of Clan Irvine until 1975. William de Irwyn (of the Irvings of Bonshaw clan) was armour bearer/secretary (and neighbour) to King Robert the Bruce. In June 1636 Sir Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum and his wife Magdalene Scrimgeour were censured for harbouring the outlaw Gilderoy.[3] Drum played a role in the Covenanting Rebellion (as did nearby Muchalls Castle) leading to its being attacked and sacked three times.\nThe castle in 1829 (by John Preston Neale)\nIn the 19th century, it was the home of Alexander Forbes Irvine of Drum FRSE (1818–1892).[4] He had inherited the estate in 1861, on the death of his father. In 1875/1876, he arranged for a restoration of the courtyard, and the addition of an arched entrance and angle tower.[5][6] He was also partly responsible for a restoration of the chapel.[7]\nThere was an older church located here; it was modified to create the chapel in the 1500s and 1600s. In 1857, the west window was enlarged and the cross was added; a new roof was also installed and some restoration of the interior was completed.[8][9]\nThe site was once served by Drum railway station on the Deeside Railway. Service was discontinued in 1951.\nRecent status\nThe castle has been a Category-A Listed property since 1987. The report states that the agreement with the National Trust was made in 1964 by Mr H.Q. Forbes Irvine, the 24th Laird, and that the agreement came into force in 1976, after 650 years of ownership by the Irvine Lairds. The summary states that the tower was built in 1280–1300, that the Jacobean Wing was added in 1619 and that modifications were made ca. 1800, 1840 and 1875. The Chapel is Category-B Listed as are the Walled Garden and East Lodge; in 1987, the garden was \"derelict\".[10]\nThe chapel, dining hall and estate may be hired for weddings and corporate functions. The current (early 2020) NTS website, however, discusses its Garden of Historic Roses, spread out over four distinct areas. The grand Victorian library with over 4,000 books was one of the attractions; the castle was also offering a \"programme of temporary exhibitions throughout the year\".[11][12] A tourism website added that the castle \"contains superb furniture and paintings. In the 16th-century chapel are a beautiful stained glass window and the Augsburg silver Madonna\". The site has a playground, a small shop and a tearoom.[13]\nThe castle, gardens and estate are open to visitors throughout the year.[14] During 2019, 47,446 people visited the castle.[15]\nArea's ancient history\nPrehistoric habitation of the local area is known through archaeological sites such as Balbridie. Roman legions marched from Raedykes to nearby Normandykes as they sought higher ground evading the bogs of Red Moss and other low-lying mosses associated with the Burn of Muchalls. That march used the Elsick Mounth, one of the ancient trackways crossing the Grampian Mountains; the situation of the Elsick Mounth terminating at a ford to the River Dee is thought to have been instrumental in the strategic siting of Drum Castle as a point to monitor traffic on the Elsick Mounth[16] lying west of Netherley.\nGallery The Rose Garden at Drum Castle Walled Garden, Drum Castle Gateway of the Walled Garden at Drum Castle North-East corner of the Walled Garden at Drum Castle Southern boundary of the Walled Garden at Drum Castle Drum Castle Chapel Drum Castle chapel Interior & Altar\nReferences\nExternal links\nDrum Castle at National Trust of Scotland\nSummer Snow - Cottonwood tree at Drum Castle\nViews of Drum Castle and chapel\n360 Virtual Tour of Drum Castle Grounds\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Ruined castle in Scotland\nRemains of Dundarg Castle, and the modern house on the site, overlooking Aberdour Bay\nDundarg Castle is a ruined castle about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) north-northeast of New Aberdour, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, built within the ramparts of an earlier Iron Age promontory fort.[1] It was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of North-East Aberdeenshire,[2] and by Charles McKean as \"Scotland's answer to Tintagel\".[3] It became a small Celtic monastery for a period.[4]\nStructure\nThe site consists of a triangle of gently sloping ground flanked by steep slopes on all sides, linked to a flat-topped elongated promontory extending to the north-east, surrounded by 20 metres (66 ft) high sandstone cliffs.[5] Its name comes from the Gaelic dun dearg, meaning red fort or castle, referring to the colour of the sandstone.[5]\nHistory\nThe 10th-century Book of Deer records the existence of a cathair or fortified place at Aberdour.[5]\nIt was built in the 13th century by the Comyn family, but was dismantled, probably by Robert the Bruce, in 1308. It was rebuilt in 1334 by Henry de Beaumont, but slighted almost immediately, after a famous siege by Sir Andrew Moray. Many medieval objects providing evidence of this double destruction were found in excavations in 1911-12 and 1950-51, led by W. Douglas Simpson.\nThe only substantial part of the castle remaining is the inner gatehouse, which survives to a height of about 18 feet (5.5 m). The upper part was rebuilt in the middle of the 16th century, probably following the Coastal Defence Commission of 1550, and there is some evidence that it was provided with gunloops at that time. The site was finally abandoned in the mid-17th century. A house was built on part of the site in 1938, reputedly by and for Wing Commander David Vaughan Carnegie, using stone from the former Aberdour Free Church.[6][7]\nThe castle and promontory fort are protected as a scheduled monument,[8] while the modern house is a category B listed building.[7]\nReferences\nBibliography\nBeveridge, W.

    "text": "Ruined castle in Scotland\nFor ships of this name, see RMS Dunottar Castle and MS Dunnottar Castle.\n\"Dunnottar\" redirects here. For other uses, see Dunnottar (disambiguation).\nDunnottar Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Fhoithear, \"fort on the shelving slope\")[1] is a ruined medieval fortress located upon a rocky headland on the northeast coast of Scotland, about 2 miles (3 kilometres) south of Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire. The surviving buildings are largely of the 15th and 16th centuries, but the site is believed to have been fortified in the Early Middle Ages. Dunnottar has played a prominent role in the history of Scotland through to the 18th-century Jacobite risings because of its strategic location and defensive strength.\nDunnottar is best known as the place where the Honours of Scotland, the Scottish crown jewels, were hidden from Oliver Cromwell's invading army in the 17th century. The property of the Keiths from the 14th century, and the seat of the Earl Marischal, Dunnottar declined after the last Earl forfeited his titles by taking part in the Jacobite rebellion of 1715. The castle was restored in the 20th century and is now open to the public.\nThe ruins of the castle are spread over 1.4 hectares (3+1⁄2 acres), surrounded by steep cliffs that drop to the North Sea, 160 feet (50 metres) below. A narrow strip of land joins the headland to the mainland, along which a steep path leads up to the gatehouse. The various buildings within the castle include the 14th-century tower house as well as the 16th-century palace. Dunnottar Castle is a scheduled monument,[2] and twelve structures on the site were listed buildings.[3]\nHistory\nEarly Middle Ages\nThis historic view of Dunnottar Castle by the Dutch engineer John Slezer is now recognised as an incorrect labelling by his engraver. It is actually Wemyss Castle in Fife\nA chapel at Dunnottar is said to have been founded by St Ninian in the 5th century,[4] although it is not clear when the site was first fortified, but in any case the legend is late and highly implausible. Possibly the earliest written reference to the site is found in the Annals of Ulster which record two sieges of 'Dún Foither' in 681 and 694. The earlier event has been interpreted as an attack by Brude, the Pictish king of Fortriu, to extend his power over the north-east coast of Scotland.[5] The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba records that King Donald II of Scotland, the first ruler to be called rí Alban (King of Alba), was killed at Dunnottar during an attack by Vikings in 900.[6] The English king Æthelstan led a force into Scotland in 934, and raided as far north as Dunnottar according to the account of Symeon of Durham.[7]\nW. D. Simpson speculated that a motte might lie under the present castle, but excavations in the 1980s failed to uncover substantive evidence of early medieval fortification. The discovery of a group of Pictish stones at Dunnicaer, a nearby sea stack, has prompted speculation that Dún Foither was actually located on the adjacent headland of Bowduns, 3 miles (5 km) to the north.[8]\nLater Middle Ages\nDuring the reign of King William the Lion (ruled 1165–1214), Dunnottar was a centre of local administration for The Mearns.[9] The castle is named in the Roman de Fergus, an early 13th-century Arthurian romance, in which the hero Fergus must travel to Dunnottar to retrieve a magic shield.[10][11] In May 1276, a church on the site was consecrated by William Wishart, Bishop of St Andrews.[10] The poet Blind Harry relates that William Wallace captured Dunnottar from the English in 1297, during the Wars of Scottish Independence. He is said to have imprisoned 4,000 English prisoners of war in the church and burned them alive.[4]\nIn 1336, Edward III of England ordered William Sinclair, 8th Baron of Roslin, to sail eight ships to the partially ruined Dunnottar for the purpose of rebuilding and fortifying the site as a forward resupply base for his northern campaign. Sinclair took with him 160 soldiers, horses, and a corps of masons and carpenters.[12] Edward himself visited in July,[13] but the English efforts were undone before the end of the year when the Scottish Regent Sir Andrew Murray led a force that captured and again destroyed the defences of Dunnottar.[4]\nIn the 14th century, Dunnottar was granted to William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland (d.1370);[14] in 1346, a licence to crenellate was issued by David II.[15][16] Around 1359, William Keith, Marischal of Scotland, married Margaret Fraser, niece of Robert the Bruce, and was granted the barony of Dunnottar at this time. Keith then gave the lands of Dunnottar to his daughter Christian and son-in-law William Lindsay of Byres, but in 1392 an excambion (exchange) was agreed whereby Keith regained Dunnottar and Lindsay took lands in Fife.[14][17] William Keith completed construction of the tower house at Dunnottar, but was excommunicated for building on the consecrated ground associated with the parish church. Keith had provided a new parish church closer to Stonehaven, but was forced to write to the Pope, Benedict XIII, who issued a bull in 1395 lifting the excommunication.[14] William Keith's descendants were made Earls Marischal in the mid 15th century, and they held Dunottar until the 18th century.[4]\n16th-century rebuilding\nGeorge Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, painted by Cosmo Alexander\nJames IV came to Dunnottar on 15 October 1504. A child played a musical instrument called a monochord for him, and he gave money to poor people. The king had brought his Italian minstrels and an African drummer, known as the \"More taubronar\".[18]\nThrough the 16th century, the Keiths improved and expanded their principal seats: at Dunnottar and also at Keith Marischal in East Lothian. James IV visited Dunnottar in 1504, and in 1531 James V exempted the Earl's men from military service on the grounds that Dunnottar was one of the \"principall strenthis of our realme\".[19] Mary, Queen of Scots, visited in 1562 after the Battle of Corrichie,[20][21] and returned in 1564.[4] James VI stayed for 10 days in 1580, as part of his progress through Fife and Angus,[22] during which a meeting of the Privy Council was convened at Dunnottar.[23] King James came again on 17 April 1589 and spent the night at Cowie watching for the Catholic rebel earls of Huntly and Erroll.[24] During the rebellion of Catholic nobles in 1592, Dunnottar was captured by Captain Carr on behalf of the Earl of Huntly, but was restored to Lord Marischal just a few weeks later.[25]\nIn 1581, George Keith succeeded as 5th Earl Marischal, and began a large-scale reconstruction that saw the medieval fortress converted into a more comfortable home. As the founder of Marischal College in Aberdeen, the 5th Earl valued Dunnottar as much for its dramatic situation as for its security.[26] A \"palace\" comprising a series of ranges around a quadrangle was built on the north-eastern cliffs, creating luxurious living quarters with sea views. The 13th-century chapel was restored and incorporated into the quadrangle.[15] An impressive stone gatehouse was constructed, now known as Benholm's Lodging, featuring numerous gun ports facing the approach. Although impressive, these are likely to have been fashionable embellishments rather than genuine defensive features.[27] The earl had a suite of 'Samson' tapestries which may have represented his religious outlook.[28]\nCivil wars\nFurther information: Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms\nWilliam Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, painted by George Jamesone in 1636\nIn 1639, William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, came out in support of the Covenanters, a Presbyterian movement who opposed the established Episcopal Church and the changes which Charles I was attempting to impose. With James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, he marched against the Catholic James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne, Earl of Huntly, and defeated an attempt by the Royalists to seize Stonehaven. However, when Montrose changed sides to the Royalists and marched north, Marischal remained in Dunnottar, even when given command of the area by Parliament, and even when Montrose burned Stonehaven.[29]\nMarischal then joined with the Engager faction, who had made a deal with the king, and led a troop of horse to the Battle of Preston (1648) in support of the royalists.[29] Following the execution of Charles I in 1649, the Engagers gave their allegiance to his son and heir. Charles II was proclaimed king, arriving in Scotland in June 1650. He visited Dunnottar in July 1650,[29] but his presence in Scotland prompted Oliver Cromwell to lead a force into Scotland, defeating the Scots at Dunbar in September 1650.[30]\nHonours of Scotland\nCharles II was crowned at Scone Palace on 1 January 1651, at which the Honours of Scotland (the regalia of crown, sword and sceptre) were used. However, with Cromwell's troops in Lothian, the honours could not be returned to Edinburgh. The Earl Marischal, as Marischal of Scotland, had formal responsibility for the honours,[29] and in June the Privy Council duly decided to place them at Dunnottar.[17] They were brought to the castle by Katherine Drummond, hidden in sacks of wool.[31] Sir George Ogilvie (or Ogilvy) of Barras was appointed lieutenant-governor of the castle, and given responsibility for its defence.[32]\nIn November 1651, Cromwell's troops called on Ogilvie to surrender, but he refused. During the subsequent blockade of the castle, the removal of the Honours of Scotland was planned by Elizabeth Douglas, wife of Sir George Ogilvie, and Christian Fletcher, wife of James Granger, minister of Kinneff Parish Church. The king's papers were first removed from the castle by Anne Lindsay, a kinswoman of Elizabeth Douglas, who walked through the besieging force with the papers sewn into her clothes.[31] Two stories exist regarding the removal of the honours themselves. Fletcher stated in 1664 that over the course of three visits to the castle in February and March 1652, she carried away the crown, sceptre, sword and sword case hidden amongst sacks of goods. Another account, given in the 18th century by a tutor to the Earl Marischal, records that the honours were lowered from the castle onto the beach, where they were collected by Fletcher's servant and carried off in a creel (basket) of seaweed. Having smuggled the honours from the castle, Fletcher and her husband buried them under the floor of the Old Kirk at Kinneff.[31]\nBy May 1652 the commander of the blockade, Colonel Thomas Morgan, had taken delivery of the artillery necessary for the reduction of Dunnottar.[32] Ogilvie surrendered on 24 May, on condition that the garrison could go free. Finding the honours gone, the Cromwellians imprisoned Ogilvie and his wife in the castle until the following year, when a false story was put about suggesting that the honours had been taken overseas.[32] Much of the castle property was removed, including twenty-one brass cannons,[33] and Marischal was required to sell further lands and possessions to pay fines imposed by Cromwell's government.[29]\nAt the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the honours were removed from Kinneff Church and returned to the king. Ogilvie quarrelled with Marischal's mother over who would take credit for saving the honours,[29] though he was eventually rewarded with a baronetcy. Fletcher was awarded 2,000 merks by Parliament but the sum was never paid.[31]\nWhigs and Jacobites\nDunnottar drawn by John Slezer in 1693\nReligious and political conflicts continued to be played out at Dunnottar through the 17th and early 18th centuries. In 1685, during the rebellion of the Earl of Argyll against the new king James VII, 167 Covenanters were seized and held in a cellar at Dunnottar. The prisoners included 122 men and 45 women associated with the Whigs, an anti-Royalist group within the Covenanter movement, and had refused to take an oath of allegiance to the new king.[34] The Whigs were imprisoned from May 24 until late July. A group of 25 escaped, although two of these were killed in a fall from the cliffs, and another 15 were recaptured.[35] Five prisoners died in the vault, and 37 of the Whigs were released after taking the oath of allegiance.[34] The remaining prisoners were transported to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, as part of a colonisation scheme devised by George Scot of Pitlochie. Many, like Scot himself, died on the voyage.[36] The cellar, located beneath the \"King's Bedroom\" in the 16th-century castle buildings, has since become known as the \"Whigs' Vault\".[34]\nBoth the Jacobites (supporters of the exiled Stuarts) and the Hanoverians (supporters of George I and his descendants) used Dunnottar Castle. In 1689, during Viscount Dundee's campaign in support of the deposed James VII, the castle was garrisoned for William III and Mary II with Lord Marischal appointed captain.[37] Seventeen suspected Jacobites from Aberdeen were seized and held in the fortress for around three weeks, including George Liddell, professor of mathematics at Marischal College.[38] In the Jacobite Rising of 1715 George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal, took an active role with the rebels, leading cavalry at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. After the subsequent abandonment of the rising Lord Marischal fled to the Continent, eventually becoming French ambassador for Frederick the Great of Prussia. Meanwhile, in 1716, his titles and estates including Dunnottar were declared forfeit to the crown.[39]\nLater history\nDunnottar Castle by James Cassie, 1857\nDunnottar Castle by Waller Hugh Paton, 1867\nThe seized estates of the Earl Marischal were purchased in 1720 for £41,172, by the York Buildings Company who dismantled much of the castle.[17] In 1761, the Earl briefly returned to Scotland and bought back Dunnottar only to sell it five years later to Alexander Keith (1736–1819),[40] an Edinburgh lawyer who served as Knight Marischal of Scotland.[17] Dunnottar was held by Alexander Keith and then his son, Sir Alexander Keith (1768–1832) before being inherited in 1852 by Sir Patrick Keith-Murray of Ochtertyre, who in turn sold it in July 1873 to Major Alexander Innes of Cowie and Raemoir for about £80,000.[41] It was purchased by Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, in 1925, after which his wife embarked on a programme of repairs.[34] Since that time, the castle has remained in the family, and has been open to the public, attracting 52,500 visitors in 2009,[42] and over 135,000 visitors in 2019.[43]\nDunnottar Castle, and the headland on which is stands, was designated as a Scheduled monument in 1970.[2]\nIn 1972, twelve of the structures at Dunnottar were listed.[3] Three buildings were listed at category A as being of \"national importance\": the keep;[44] the entrance gateway;[45] and Benholm's Lodging.[46] The remaining listings were at category B as being of \"regional importance\".[47] However, in 2018, the listed status for those buildings was removed as part of Historic Environment Scotland's \"Dual Designation 2A Project\".[44][45][48][46][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56]\nThe Hon. Charles Anthony Pearson, the younger son of the 3rd Viscount Cowdray, currently owns and runs Dunnottar Castle which is part of the 210-square-kilometre (81 sq mi) Dunecht Estates.[57] Portions of the 1990 film Hamlet, starring Mel Gibson and Glenn Close, were shot there.[58] In the Disney movie Brave, Dunnottar Castle was chosen for Merida's home.\nDescription\nPlan of Dunnottar Castle Key: A Gatehouse and Benholm's Lodging · B Tunnels · C Tower house · D Forge · E Waterton's Lodging · F Stables · G Palace · H Chapel · I Postern gate · J Whigs' Vault · K Bowling green · L Sentry box · M Cliffs · N North Sea\nDunnottar's strategic location allowed its owners to control the coastal terrace between the North Sea cliffs and the hills of the Mounth, 2+1⁄4 miles (3.6 km) inland, which enabled access to and from the north-east of Scotland.[59] The site is accessed via a steep, 2,600-foot (790 m) footpath (with modern staircases) from a car park on the coastal road, or via a 3-kilometre (2 mi) cliff-top path from Stonehaven.\nDunnottar's several buildings, put up between the 13th and 17th centuries, are arranged across a headland covering around 1.4 hectares (3+1⁄2 acres).[9] The dominant building, viewed from the land approach, is the 14th-century keep or tower house. The other principal buildings are the gatehouse; the chapel; and the 16th-century \"palace\" which incorporates the \"Whigs' Vault\".\nDefences\nThe gatehouse (centre) and Benholm's Lodging (left) seen from within the castle\nThe approach to the castle is overlooked by outworks on the \"Fiddle Head\", a promontory on the western side of the headland. The entrance is through the well-defended main gate, set in a curtain wall which entirely blocks a cleft in the rocky cliffs.[60] The gate has a portcullis and has been partly blocked up. Alongside the main gate is the 16th-century Benholm's Lodging, a five-storey building cut into the rock, which incorporated a prison with apartments above.[15] Three tiers of gun ports face outwards from the lower floors of Benholm's Lodging, while inside the main gate, a group of four gun ports face the entrance. The entrance passage then turns sharply to the left, running underground through two tunnels to emerge near the tower house.[9]\nSimpson contends that these defences are \"without exception the strongest in Scotland\",[61] although later writers have doubted the effectiveness of the gun ports. Cruden notes that the alignment of the gun ports in Benholm's Lodging, facing across the approach rather than along, means that they are of limited efficiency.[62] The practicality of the gun ports facing the entrance has also been questioned,[15] though an inventory of 1612 records that four brass cannons were placed here.[63]\nA second access to the castle leads up from a rocky cove, the aperture to a marine cave on the northern side of the Dunnottar cliffs into which a small boat could be brought. From here a steep path leads to the well-fortified postern gate on the cliff-top, which in turn offers access to the castle via the Water Gate in the palace. Artillery defences, taking the form of earthworks, surround the north-west corner of the castle, facing inland, and the south-east, facing seaward.[33] A small sentry box or guard house stands by the eastern battery, overlooking the coast.[64]\nTower house and surrounding buildings\nThe tower house of Dunnottar, viewed from the west\nThe late 14th-century tower house has a stone-vaulted basement, and originally had three further storeys and a garret above.[4] Measuring 40 by 36 feet (12 by 11 m), the tower house stood 50 feet (15 m) high to its gable.[65] The principal rooms included a great hall and a private chamber for the lord, with bedrooms upstairs.[15] Beside the tower house is a storehouse, and a blacksmith's forge with a large chimney. A stable block is ranged along the southern edge of the headland. Nearby is Waterton's Lodging, also known as the Priest's House, built around 1574,[66] possibly for the use of William Keith (died 1580), son of the 4th Earl Marischal.[15] This small self-contained house includes a hall and kitchen at ground level, with private chambers above, and has a projecting spiral stair on the north side.[66] It is named for Thomas Forbes of Waterton, an attendant of the 7th Earl.[67]\nPalace\nThe palace, from the south-west, with the Silver House in the foreground, and the chapel on the right\nThe palace, to the north-east of the headland, was built in the late 16th century and early to mid-17th century. It comprises three main wings set out around a quadrangle, and for the most part is probably the work of the 5th Earl Marischal who succeeded in 1581.[nb 1] It provided extensive and comfortable accommodation to replace the rooms in the tower house. In its long, low design it has been compared to contemporary English buildings, in contrast to the Scottish tradition of taller towers still prevalent in the 16th century.[68]\nSeven identical lodgings are arranged along the west range, each opening onto the quadrangle and including windows and fireplaces. Above the lodgings of the west range comprised a 120-foot (37 m) gallery. Now roofless, the gallery originally had an elaborate oak ceiling, and on display was a Roman tablet taken from the Antonine Wall.[69][nb 2] At the north end of the gallery was a drawing room linked to the north range. The gallery could also be accessed from the Silver House to the south, which incorporated a broad stairway with a treasury above.[15]\nDunnottar castle viewed from above the entry path\nThe basement of the north range incorporates kitchens and stores, with a dining room and great chamber above. At ground floor level is the Water Gate, between the north and west ranges, which gives access to the postern on the northern cliffs.[70] The east and north ranges are linked via a rectangular stair. The east range has a larder, brewhouse and bakery at ground level, with a suite of apartments for the countess above. A north-east wing contains the Earl's apartments, and includes the \"King's Bedroom\" in which Charles II stayed. In this room is a carved stone inscribed with the arms of the 7th Earl and his wife, and the date 1645. Below these rooms is the Whigs' Vault, a cellar measuring 52 by 15 ft (15.8 by 4.6 m). This cellar, in which the Covenanters were held in 1685, has a large eastern window, as well as a lower vault accessed via a trapdoor in the floor.[71] Of the chambers in the palace, only the dining room and the Silver House remain roofed, having been restored in the 1920s.\nThe central area contains a circular cistern or fish pond, 50 ft (15 m) across and 25 ft (7.6 m) deep,[72] and a bowling green is located to the west.[4] At the south-east corner of the quadrangle is the chapel, consecrated in 1276 and largely rebuilt in the 16th century. Medieval walling and two 13th-century windows remain, and there is a graveyard to the south.[9][15] Dunnottar Castle\nSee also\nDunnottar Parish Church\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nAlcock, Leslie; Alcock, Elizabeth A (1992). \"Reconnaissance excavations on Early Historic fortifications and other royal sites in Scotland, 1974–84; 5: A, Excavations & other fieldwork at Forteviot, Perthshire, 1981; B, Excavations at Urquhart Castle, Inverness-shire, 1983; C, Excavations at Dunnottar, Kincardineshire, 1984\" (PDF).

    "text": "Castle on the coast of Banff and Buchan, Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nFindlater Castle.\nclass=notpageimage| Findlater Castle shown within the United Kingdom(grid reference NJ541672)\nFindlater Castle is the old seat of the Earls of Findlater and Seafield, sitting on a 50-foot (15 m)-high cliff overlooking the Moray Firth on the coast of Banff and Buchan, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nLocation and etymology\nIt lies about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Banff, near the village of Sandend, between Cullen and Portsoy. The cliffs here contain quartz; the name \"Findlater\" is derived from the Scots Gaelic words fionn (\"white\") and leitir (\"cliff or steep slope\").\nHistory\nThe first historical reference to the castle is from 1246. King Alexander III of Scotland repaired this castle in the 1260s in preparation for an invasion by King Haakon IV of Norway. The Norwegians took and held the castle for some time. The castle remains that are still there are from the 14th-century rebuilding, when the castle was redesigned based on the Roslyn Castle model.\nJames V of Scotland visited Findlater in November 1535 after a pilgrimage to Tain.[1] The Laird of Findlater, an Ogilvy, was Master of Household to Mary of Guise. He lost his inheritance following sexual misconduct with his mother-in-law and making a plan to imprison his father in a cellar to deprive him of sleep and drive him insane to obtain his lands. After his father's death his mother married John Gordon, a son of the Earl of Huntly, who then took possession of the castle and lands, and promptly imprisoned her.[2]\nJohn Gordon, now of Findlater, fought with Lord Ogilvy in July 1562 and injured his arm.[3] Gordon was imprisoned in Edinburgh until his victim healed, according to custom.[4] In September 1562 Mary, Queen of Scots sent an army equipped with artillery from Dunbar Castle to besiege Findlater, and eject John Gordon of Findlater.[5] When Mary was nearby on 20 September, she had sent her trumpeter messenger to deliver the castle to the captain of her guard, but he was refused.[6] In October 1562 the Earl of Huntly sent Mary the keys of Findlater and Auchindoun, but she was suspicious of the low status of the messenger.[7]\nJames Ogilvy, 1st Earl of Findlater, was given the earldom in 1638. He built the nearby Cullen House to take the place of the castle as the family seat and by the time he died in 1653 it was little used and in decline.\nConservation\nThe castle is a scheduled monument.[8]\nReferences\nExternal links\nFindlater family site\nPortsoy poets site\nTake a 360 Virtual Tour of Findlater Castle\n57°41′32.60″N 2°46′13.47″W / 57.6923889°N 2.7704083°W / 57.6923889; -2.7704083\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nLocation of Fyvie Castle within the former Grampian region\nFyvie Castle - painting by James Giles\nFyvie Castle is a castle in the village of Fyvie, near Turriff in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.\nHistory\nThe earliest parts of Fyvie Castle date from the 13th century – some sources claim it was built in 1211 by William the Lion. Fyvie was the site of an open-air court held by Robert the Bruce, and Charles I lived there as a child for 4 years. Following the Battle of Otterburn in 1388, it ceased to be a royal stronghold as it was passed to Henry Preston as a reward from Robert iii.[clarification needed]. Instead, it fell into the possession of five successive families – Preston, Meldrum, Seton, Gordon and Forbes-Leith – each of whom added a new tower to the castle. The oldest of these, the Preston Tower (located on the far right as one faces the main facade of Fyvie), dates to between 1390 and 1433. The impressive Seton tower forms the entrance, and was erected in 1599 by Alexander Seton. He commissioned the great wheel staircase several years later. The Gordon Tower followed in 1777, and the Leith in 1890.\nInside, the castle stronghold features a great wheel stair, a display of original arms and armour, and a collection of portraits, from artists such as Henry Raeburn, Pompeo Batoni and Thomas Gainsborough.\nManus O'Cahan and Montrose fought a successful minor battle against the Covenant Army at Fyvie Castle on 28 October 1644. The battlefield was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland in 2011.[1] Anne Halkett stayed at the castle from 1650 to 1652 with the Countess of Dunfermline, she treated wounded soldiers and the illnesses of local people, and negotiated with the English major of a company of Commonwealth soldiers, and with three Colonels, Lilburne, Fitts, and Overton.[2]\nThe grounds and adjoining Fyvie Lake were landscaped in the 18th century by Col. William Gordon. The Scottish industrialist Alexander Leith (later Baron Leith of Fyvie) bought the castle in 1885. His descendants sold it to the National Trust for Scotland in 1984.\nTo the east there is a walled garden where Scottish fruits are currently cultivated.[3] There is evidence for two other walled gardens closer to the castle itself to its west and south.[4] The one to the west appears on an estate plan of 1768.[5]\nGhostlore\nThe castle (like many places in Scotland) has ghostlore associated with it.[6] A story is told that in 1920 during renovation work the skeleton of a woman was discovered behind a bedroom wall. On the day the remains were laid to rest in Fyvie cemetery, the castle residents started to be plagued by strange noises and unexplained happenings. Fearing he had offended the dead woman, the Laird of the castle had the skeleton exhumed and replaced behind the bedroom wall, at which point the haunting ceased. It is said that there is a secret room in the south-west corner of the castle that must remain sealed lest anyone entering meet with disaster.[7] It is unclear if this is the same room in which the skeleton was found. There is also an indelible blood stain, two ghosts and two curses associated with this place.[8]\nOne of the curses has been attributed to the prophetic laird, Thomas the Rhymer. The curse is said to have been part of the mysterious three weeping stones. The curse decrees that until all three stones taken from the castle's boundary marks are brought together, the firstborn sons of the families who live at Fyvie will never inherit the castle. Only one weeping stone is known to exist and is kept at the castle. The other two have never been found, with one built into the castle walls and the other in the depths of the river Ythan. The second curse involves a hidden room in the charter room. The curse is very specific: death to the lord of the castle and blindness to his wife if anyone disturbs it.\nIn the media\nFyvie Castle has featured in a number of British television programmes, such as Living TV's Most Haunted series 6[9] and STV's Castles of Scotland.\nThe castle also played host of the setting of a children's gameshow on CBBC called Spook Squad in 2004.\n2009 saw the publication of the children's fantasy novel, The Time-Tailor and the Fyvie Castle Witch Trials, written by Deborah Leslie. The castle was also featured in the BBC documentary Castle Ghosts of Scotland,[10] narrated by Robert Hardy. In recent years, the castle grounds have hosted a Fyvie Live music festival in the summer, which was headlined in 2011 by Beverley Knight and in 2012 by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, then following a gap of several years, by The Shires in 2017. Following the revival, it was announced that the event would take place again in 2018, with Ward Thomas as the headline act. in August 2024 it also hosted re-enactors from all over the country to bring a re-enactment of the battle of Fyvie 1644.\nToday, the castle is open to tourists between April and October. It is also a wedding venue.\nSide view of the castle\nReferences\nExternal links\nFyvie Castle – National Trust for Scotland\nFyvie Castle Grounds Virtual Tour\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

Before her defeat of the Gordons at the Battle of Corrichie in October 1562, Mary, Queen of Scots stayed here.[1]\nThe castle ruins were demolished in 1975,[1] with the last remains removed by 1982.[2]\nStructure\nThere is no longer any trace of the castle, which had a keep.[1] In 1780 it was reported to Thomas Pennant that the castle was “an old building,.., placed on a small mount, and surrounded with a deep ditch. It is a square tower; one end of it is fallen down, and shews a section of strong vaulted rooms; but there seemed nothing so singular in its structure, as to merit more particular attention”.[2]\nGartly Castle was constructed on a natural mound about 17 metres (56 ft) across and up to 2.5 metres (8 ft 2 in) high. There was a ditch to the south, east and west.[3]\nCastles in Great Britain and Ireland\nList of castles in Scotland\nReferences\n^ a b c d Coventry, Martin (1997) The Castles of Scotland.

    "text": "Ruined castle in Scotland\nFor HM Castle Huntly, a 15th-century castle west of Dundee that is now used as a prison, see Castle Huntly.\nHuntly Castle is a ruined castle north of Huntly in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where the rivers Deveron and Bogie meet.[1] It was the ancestral home of the chief of Clan Gordon, Earl of Huntly. There have been four castles built on the site that have been referred to as Huntly Castle, Strathbogie Castle or Peel of Strathbogie.[1][2]\nLocation\nHuntly Castle was built on the crossing of the rivers Deveron and Bogie, north of Huntly and roughly 40 miles from Aberdeen. The original wooden castle was built on a motte. The second castle, made of stone, was built on the northern end of the bailey. The third and modern castles were built to the east of the original, at the southern end of the estate.[2]\nHistory\nThe castle was originally built by Duncan II, Earl of Fife, on the Strathbogie estate sometime around 1180 and 1190.[2][1] The castle became known as the Peel of Strathbogie.[3]\nThe Earl Duncan's third son, David, inherited the Strathbogie estate and later, through marriage, became earls of Atholl around 1204.[1] During the Strathbogie family's time at the estate, Robert the Bruce was a guest after falling ill at Inverurie. The family was loyal to him and when he got better, Robert the Bruce went on to win the battle of Bannockburn.[3] However, around 1314, David of Strathbogie shifted his support to the English right before Robert the Bruce won the battle of Bannockburn. Robert the Bruce saw this as treachery and granted the castle and estate to Sir Adam Gordon of Huntly because he was consistently loyal. In 1506, the castle was officially renamed Huntly Castle.[2]\nReign of James IV\nAlthough the castle was burned to the ground, a grander castle was built in its place. In 1496, the pretender to the English throne, Perkin Warbeck, was married to Lady Catherine Gordon the daughter of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, witnessed by King James IV of Scotland at Edinburgh. James IV came to Huntly in October 1501 and gave gifts of money to the stonemasons working on the castle. In October 1503, James IV came again and played in a shooting contest at a target called a \"prop\".[4] He came back again in the following October, on his way south, accompanied by four Italian minstrels and an African drummer known as the \"More taubronar\".[5] James IV played cards at the castle on 10 October 1505 and gave a tip to masons working on the building. These visits were part of his annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Duthac at Tain.[6] Architecturally the L plan castle consists of a well-preserved five-story tower with an adjoining great hall and supporting buildings. Areas of the original ornate facade and interior stonework remain. Wings were added to the castle in the 16th and 17th centuries.\nCarved inscriptions feature on the facade\nReign of Mary, Queen of Scots\nWilliam Mackintosh was executed on 23 August 1550 at \"Castle Strathbogie\", as a conspirator against the Earl of Huntly, the queen's lieutenant in the North.[7]\nThe English diplomat Thomas Randolph stayed two nights in September 1562,[8] and wrote that the castle was \"fayer, beste furnishede of anye howse that I have seen in thys countrie.\"[9] Mary, Queen of Scots decided to take the castle, giving as a cause that the Earl withheld from her a royal cannon lent to him by Regent Arran.[10] She sent her half-brother John Stewart, Commendator of Coldingham to arrest the George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly at Huntly Castle in October 1562. On the day William Kirkcaldy of Grange and the Tutor of Pitcur arrived first and surrounded the house. While Kirkcaldy was talking to the castle porter, the castle watchman on the tower spotted Coldingham and the Master of Lindsay and their troops a mile off. He alerted the Earl, who ran without \"boot or sword\" and hopped over a low wall at the back of the castle and found a horse before Pitcur could stop him. Elizabeth Keith, Countess of Huntly then welcomed the queen's men and gave them a meal and showed them around the place. She still had her chapel furnished for Roman Catholic worship.[11]\nGeorge Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly died after the Battle of Corrichie on 28 October 1562, and the castle was garrisoned for Mary, Queen of Scots by Charles Crawfurd and twenty soldiers. Furnishings including beds and 45 tapestries were carted to Aberdeen and shipped in barrels to Edinburgh for the royal collection and refurbishment by Servais de Condé.[12] After the surrender of Mary, Queen of Scots, at the battle of Carberry Hill, the Earl of Bothwell came north to meet George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly at \"Stawboggye\", and moved on to Spynie Castle after Huntly deserted his cause.[13] In July 1570 the exiled Earl of Westmorland found refuge at Huntly.[14]\nJohn Gordon, Earl of Sutheerland\nJohn Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland and his wife Marion Seton were poisoned at Helmsdale Castle in 1567 by Isobel Sinclair, the wife of Gordon of Gartly.[15] Isobel Seton's own son also died, but the fifteen-year-old heir of Sutherland, Alexander Gordon was unharmed. He was made to marry the Earl of Caithness' daughter Barbara Sinclair. In 1569 he escaped from the Sinclairs to Huntly Castle and remained at Huntly until he came of age in 1573. Barbara Sinclair died, and Alexander Gordon, now Earl of Sutherland, married Jean Gordon, former wife of the Earl of Bothwell, who had also found a refuge at Huntly Castle.[16]\nA fatal football match\nAn early description of the death of George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly in 1576, compiled by Richard Bannatyne gives some details of how the castle was used.[17] The Earl suffered a stroke, or a collapse caused by food poisoning, while playing football outside the Castle on the Green. He was taken through the outer gate to his bedchamber in the round tower of the palace block, which was then called the \"New Warke of Strathbogie.\" The Earl's bedchamber was adjacent to his \"Grit Chalmer\", the Great Chamber. After the Earl died, his body was laid out in the \"Chamber of Dais\", another name for the Great Chamber, and his valuables were secured in the bedchamber. After the Earl's steward left the castle, a number of alleged supernatural events occurred beginning with the sudden collapse of one of the servants in the \"Laich Chalmer\", Low Chamber. This \"Laich Chalmer\" was in another part of the castle, under a stair opposite the \"Auld Hall.\" On the following day, a servant went up to the Gallery at the top of the \"New Warke\" where spices (which were precious) were stored. This servant and two companions also collapsed and when revived complained of feeling cold. After the Earl's body was embalmed and taken to the chapel, his brother sat on a bench in the Hall by the Great Chamber door, and heard unexplained sounds from the chamber. It was said that \"there is not a live thing bigger than a mouse may enter in that chamber with the door locked.\"[18]\nEngraving of the castle by James Fittler in Scotia Depicta, published 1804\nRear courtyard ruins of Huntly Castle\nJames VI slights the castle\nIn March 1584 an English recusant Catholic Sir Thomas Gerard of Bryn was sent by Lady Ferniehirst to find refuge at Huntly.[19] George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly was a Catholic and James VI decided to subdue his power in the north. The king arrived at Huntly on 26 April 1589 after spending a night at Kintore. The Earl of Huntly had fled to the mountains, stripping the countryside and emptying the house of furniture. James brought 100 workmen to demolish the castle. Huntly sent the king an offer to spare the house and surrendered.[20]\nIn March 1593 a royal garrison of 16 men commanded by Archie Carmichael was to be put in Huntly Castle.[21] In May 1593 the Earl captured a man called Pedder in the lands of Atholl. Pedder was hanged and dismembered and his body parts displayed on poles at Huntly.[22]\nIn July 1594 Huntly was overseeing the building of a new hall and gallery.[23] Following the battle of Glenlivet, James VI came with workmen again and his master of works William Schaw, and planned to blow up the \"gret old tower\" which had been \"fourteen years in building\" on 29 October 1594.[24] The kirk minister Andrew Melville was with the king and a vocal advocate for demolition.[25] Aberdeen town council bought twenty stones in weight of gunpowder for the demolition of Huntly and other places,[26] and sent the stonemason John Fraser and other workmen to the demolition work at Huntly and Old Slains Castle, equipped with new shovels.[27]\nThe royal council met at Terrisoule to discuss the planned demolition on 28 October. Some Lords wanted the fortress kept to hold a loyal garrison. James VI still wished the whole castle, the new and old work, to be slighted.[28] It was decided not to completely demolish Huntly and Slains Castle and other houses, but preserve them for the convenience of the royal garrisons. It was also said that the pleas of the Countesses of Huntly and Erroll to save the houses were successful.[29] David Foulis wrote to Anthony Bacon that Henrietta Stewart, Countess of Huntly, watched the demolition at Huntly and was not allowed to have an audience with the king to plead her case.[30] The king made his friend Sir John Gordon of Pitlurg the keeper of the remaining buildings at Huntly.[31]\nRestored for a Marquess\nThe Marquess of Huntly restored and rebuilt the castle.[32] In 1746, an English soldier, James Ray, saw the ruins and commented on ceilings, still decorated with \"history-painting\".[33]\nHuntly spent large sums restoring and enlarging the castle in April 1597.[34] The restored facade of the main block was carved with the names and titles of the marquess, \"George Gordon\" and his wife, \"Henrietta Stewart\" who was a favourite of the queen, Anne of Denmark.[35] In February 1603 James VI made plans to resolve the Marquess's feuds including a royal visit to Huntly with Anne of Denmark and the Earl of Moray later in the year. The visit did not take place because of the death of Elizabeth I and the subsequent Union of the Crowns.[36]\nIn 1640 the Castle was occupied by the Scottish Covenanter army under Major-General Robert Monro (d. 1680). James Gordon Parson of Rothiemay tells us how the house \"was preserved from being rifled or defaced, except some emblems and imagery, which looked somewhat popish and superstitious lycke; and therefore, by the industry of one captain James Wallace (one of Munro's foote captaines) were hewd and brocke doune off the frontispiece of the house; but all the rest of the frontispiece containing Huntly's scutcheon, etc, was left untouched, as it stands to this daye.\"\nCaptured in October 1644, the castle was briefly held by James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose against the Duke of Argyll. In 1647 it was gallantly defended against General David Leslie by Lord Charles Gordon, but its 'Irish' garrison was starved into surrender. Savage treatment was meted out, for the men were hanged and their officers beheaded. In December of the same year the Marquess of Huntly himself was captured and on his way to execution at Edinburgh was detained, by a refinement of cruelty, in his own mansion. His escort was shot against its walls.\nAn inventory made by the garrison shows the state rooms were still fully furnished, including the earl's 'chapel bed'.[37] In 1650 Charles II visited briefly on his way to the Battle of Worcester, defeat and exile. The Civil War brought an end to the Gordon of Huntly family's long occupation of the castle.\nIn 1689, during the first Jacobite rising, the castle was briefly the headquarters for Viscount Dundee and his Jacobite army, at the end of April, just after the start of the revolt. However, by the early eighteenth century the castle was already in decay and providing material for predatory house builders in the village. In 1746, during a later Jacobite rising, it was occupied by British government troops. Thereafter, it became a common quarry until a groundswell of antiquarian sentiment in the 19th century came to the rescue of the noble pile.\nHuntly Castle remained under the ownership of the Clan Gordon until 1923. Today, the remains of the castle are cared for by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.[38]\nPure Strength I, a major international strongman competition, was held on the grounds of Huntly Castle in 1987. The winner of the contest was Jón Páll Sigmarsson of Iceland.[39]\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"History\". www.historicenvironment.scot.

    "text": "Ruined castle in Kildrummy, Aberdeenshire, Scotland\nKildrummy Castle is a ruined castle near Kildrummy, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Though ruined, it is one of the most extensive castles dating from the 13th century to survive in eastern Scotland, and was the seat of the Earls of Mar. It is owned today by Historic Environment Scotland and is open to the public as a scheduled ancient monument[1] with gardens that are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.[2]\nHistory\nThe castle was probably built in the mid-13th century under Gilbert de Moravia. It has been posited that siting of Kildrummy Castle was influenced by the location of the Grampian Mounth trackway crossings, particularly the Elsick Mounth and Cryne Corse Mounth.[3] Kildrummy Castle underwent siege numerous times in its history, first in defence of the family of Robert the Bruce in August–September 1306 (leading to the executions of Nigel Bruce and many other Scots),[4] and again in 1335 by David of Strathbogie. On this occasion Christina Bruce held off the attackers until her husband Sir Andrew Murray came to her rescue.[5] In the reign of David II, Walter Maule of Panmure was warden of Kildrummy Castle.[6]\nIn 1403-4 Alexander Stewart, murdered Sir Malcolm Drummond and then took his widow, Isabel Douglas, Countess of Mar, by force and laid claim to Kildrummy and the title of \"Earl of Mar\". In 1435 it was taken over by James I and became a royal castle. In 1468 Henry Kinghorn was keeper of Kildrummy Castle for James III and spent £100 Scots on building works and repairs.[7] James IV granted the keeping of Kildrummy and its lands to Alexander Elphinstone, 1st Lord Elphinstone and his wife Elizabeth Barlow in 1507.[8]\nThe castle passed from the Clan Elphinstone to the Clan Erskine before being abandoned in 1716 following the failure of the Jacobite Rising of 1715.\nIn 1538 the castle was raided by John Strachan, the young laird of Lenturk, who took furnishings and fixtures. Strachan brought a blacksmith to remove the ironwork from the windows and doors. Some of the metal was turned into horseshoes and used to mend ploughs at the Kirktoun of Glenbuchat.[9]\nIn May 1585 Margaret Haldane, the wife of David Erskine, Commendator of Dryburgh, was held at Kildrummy in the custody of the Master of Elphinstone.[10] In 1645 Robert Farquharson of Invercauld was the keeper of Kildrummy Castle for the Earl of Mar and his son Lord Erskine. The laird of Glenkindie also helped to keep the castle, fearing the depredations that a garrison of outsider or \"stranger\" soldiers would make on his lands.[11]\nArchitecture\nKildrummy Castle is \"shield-shaped\" in plan with a number of independent towers. The flat side of the castle overlooks a steep ravine; moreover, on the opposite side of the castle the walls come to a point, which was once defended by a massive twin-towered gatehouse. The castle also had a keep, called the Snow Tower, taller than the other towers, built in the French style, as at Bothwell Castle. Extensive earthworks protected the castle, including a dry moat and the ravine. Most of the castle foundations are now visible, along with most of its lower-storey walls.

    "text": "Historic baronial fortress\nLauriston Castle stands on a clifftop site near the Aberdeenshire village of St Cyrus and just over a mile inland from the North Sea coast of Scotland. Once a royal fortress, it can claim to be one of the oldest privately owned and inhabited castles in the region. It is a Category C listed building.[1]\nHistory\n9th century\nBy tradition, it was the stronghold of Giric, Grig or Gregory the Great, one of the last of the Pictish kings (AD 878–889). The site of his church of Ecclesgreig (Eglise Grig) is nearby and he gave his Latin name, Ciricius, to St. Cyrus.[2]\n13th – 17th centuries\nLauriston’s first charter is dated 1243 and it soon developed into a classic courtyard castle which was savagely fought over during Scotland's Wars of Independence and strengthened by King Edward III in 1336 as part of the chain of strongholds which he hoped would prevent a French landing in support of the Scots.\nOne of the corner towers on the edge of the cliff was incorporated into a typical laird’s house in the 1500s. In turn, this house was absorbed into a very large Georgian mansion of Palladian design, dated 1765–89.\nFor nearly 450 years Lauriston was held by the Stratons, whose arms of 1292 are among the earliest recorded in Scotland.[3] The eloquent Declaration of Arbroath, the famous letter of 1320 to Pope John XXII, sealed by the nation’s earls and barons, has as its final signatory the name of Alexander Straton.\nAnother Straton, the “noble knicht o’ Lauriston”, fell at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, and shortly afterwards his son was involved in the affair of the Sheriff’s Kettle. The barons of the Mearns had been complaining about the high-handed behaviour of John Melville of Glenbervie, Sheriff of Kincardineshire, and King James’s Regent, the Duke of Albany, exclaimed in exasperation that he would not mind if they \"biled the loon and suppit the bree\". Taking this as royal licence, a group of barons lured Melville to a hunting party, tipped him into a cauldron or kettle of boiling water and, to seal the conspiracy, supped the broth.[4]\nThe Stratons continued, however, to prosper at Lauriston, even surviving the events of 1534, when David Straton fell out with the Church over payment of tithes on the salmon fishery. He objected to giving every tenth fish to the Abbot of Arbroath and told “his servants to cast the tenth fish into the sea againe\", saying that God could catch his own. For this evasion of Church taxes he was taken to Edinburgh and condemned to death, thus becoming one of Scotland's first Protestant martyrs.[5]\n17th – 18th centuries\nIn 1695, the Stratons were forced to sell Lauriston. Under the charter to the new owner, Court of Session Judge, Sir James Falconer of Phesdo, the estate became a burgh of barony, with a freeport at Miltonhaven.[6][7] The name of the barony was also changed to Miltonhaven, but storms in the 1790s swept away both the port and village, leaving Lauriston to be known as “The Drown’d Barony”. Over the following century, the policies were developed in fashionable Picturesque style, with waterfalls, walks and a two-acre walled garden.\n20th century\nFollowing its use as RAF barracks during World War II, part of the mansion was demolished, and according to Nigel Tranter, the castle had “fallen on evil days indeed”.[8][9]\nLauriston's Great Hall and Doocot Tower were rebuilt in the late 1980s by William and Dorothy Newlands of Lauriston to plans drawn up by architect Ian Begg.[10] The doocot received a Glenfiddich Living Scotland Award in 1992.\nLady Lauriston is chair of the Scottish Castles Association.\nReferences\n56°47′23″N 2°23′44″W / 56.7896°N 2.3955°W / 56.7896; -2.3955\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Old medieval Scottish castle\nFor Craighall Castle, the castle of Clan Rattray, see Blairgowrie and Rattray.\nCastle Hill in 2008, all that is left of the original site\nRattray Castle, one of the nine castles of the Knuckle The Castle of Rattray was a medieval Scottish castle, with multiple variations on its structure over approximately six centuries. Originally built as a \"late 12th- or early 13th century defensive motte\"[1] it provided protection for Starny Keppie Harbour and Rattray village. Sometime between 1214 and 1233 it was upgraded by William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan before being destroyed in the 1308 Harrying of Buchan. After Comyn's timber castle was burned down, it was replaced by a stronger stone castle which was engulfed during a 1720 sand storm along with nearby Rattray village. After the storm, the castle was not dug out and remains covered to this day. The castle was described by W. Douglas Simpson as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, referring to the rocky headland of north-east Aberdeenshire.[2]\nLocation\nThe castle was sited on Castlehill, on the south bank of the now-closed estuary flowing into Strathbeg Bay- the north bank was protected by the opposite Lonmay Castle.[3] Specifically the castle was \"beside an inlet which led from the sea into a sheltered harbour\"[4] on \"the harbour side\" of Rattray village.[3] The later stone castle is known to have had a \"harbour-side entrance\".[5]\nOriginally situated on \"a rock near the sea\",[6][7] Castlehill is today about 1 mile inland as shifting sands have significantly altered the shape of the coast. Located to the south of Loch Strathbeg it can be seen as a grassy \"circular mound\"[8] which is \"oval & natural with its top slightly dished\".[5] A 1791 book states it has a \"summit\"... [of] \"half a Scots acre\"[9] (approx. 0.25 hectare) and \"rises 38 feet\"... (11.6 metres) \"above a small plain on the\"... north-east \"but is only 12 or 14 feet\"... (3.7 or 4.3 metres) \"above the higher ground\"[10] to the south-west.\nHistory\n1100 AD to 1200\nThe first construction of Castlehill was a small keep during the late middle ages, or a 12th century \"timber castle or Motte\"[4] built to protect the estuary.\nComyn period (1200 to 1308)\nIn the 13th century, the Castle of Rattray was \"the principal seat of the Cummings\"... [alt. spelling of Comyn] \"Earls of Buchan\"[11] who arrived at the start of that century. Between 1214 when he inherited the Earldom of Buchan and his own death in 1233, William Comyn, jure uxoris Earl of Buchan[7][8] built upon the motte but it is unclear whether he upgraded the existing buildings or built an entirely new castle. He is known to have completed a \"manor house\"[4] with \"a fine timber-framed hall\"[4] (the castle) which was accompanied by the private St Mary's Chapel which he constructed \"a quarter of a mile\"[10] (0.4 kilometres) south, in Rattray village itself.\nIn the mid-1270s, it is reported that \"a castle-strengthening programme Rattray\"[12] took place.\nComyn's castle survived until the Harrying of Buchan in the summer of 1308,[6] when all the Comyn lands were bloodily burned to the ground after John Comyn, Earl of Buchan was beaten at the Battle of Barra. The timber Rattray Castle was almost certainly attacked by Robert the Bruce or his younger brother Edward after which the \"castle fell into ruins\"[10] if not burned to the ground.\n1308 to ~1720\nFollowing the harrying, the site of Rattray's timber castle was rebuilt with a \"stone-built hall\".[4] This stone incarnation provided protection for Starnie Keppie Harbour and the village of Rattray, as the previous incarnations did.\nThe Earldom of Buchan and hence the castle was inherited and divided after the harrying between John Comyn's two nieces.[13] Henry de Beaumont, the husband of one niece; Alice Comyn, claimed the title under her name but was disinherited from the lands in 1314. A 1324 charter from Robert the Bruce then gives the \"lordship of Rattray\" to Sir Archibald Douglas.[14] The lands again change hands in 1382 when Alexander Stewart was given the Earldom by his father Robert II of Scotland.\nMary, Queen of Scots, declared Rattray a Royal Burgh in 1563 \"to put an end to the disputes about superiority over it between William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal and George Hay, 7th Earl of Erroll\".[7] The importance of the Burgh is questionable due to the fact \"it does not appear to have long enjoyed that privilege not being ranked in the roll of boroughs for many ages\" [15] and as it was \"said to have had all the privileges of a royal borough, except sending members to parliament.\"[16]\nIn later years Rattray was run by a feudal system of superiors who maintained the land for the Crown, some of whom are known due to charters that they granted. \"David Rivis\"... \"superior of the lands of Rattray\"[17] granted a charter in 1617; \"William Watson of Haddo, bailie of the burgh of Rattray, superior\"[17] [of Rattray] granted a charter in 1675 and \"Charles\".. [Hay, 13th] \"Earl of Erroll, superior of the lands of Rattray\"[17] granted a charter in 1711.\nThe destruction of the stone castle and the nearby village of Rattray, is said by \"a tradition\"[7] to have happened during the great storm of 1720[18] which cut off Strathbeg Bay. It is believed that the castle was \"blown over with sand one Sunday evening while the\"[7] inhabitants, \"a godless crew\".[18] \"were engaged in playing cards\".[7] \"on the Sabbath, [when] they were buried alive.\"[18]\nAnother story says that the site was \"buried because of the plague.\"[7] However there is no date or record of which plague and it is a very unlikely account.\n~1720 to 1988\nToday there is not much to be seen at the site as the remains have \"for a long period [been] covered with a deep soil, and now- the swords of the warlike house beaten literally into ploughshares\".[19] In c. 1730, a dig at the south-east \"side of the Castle Hill\"... \"found a great number of stones, supposed to belong to the kitchen of the castle, as\"... \"workmen found very large hearthstones covered with ashes.\"[20]\nItems recovered include; \"a quantity of regularly-laid stones were removed c. 1734 and some silver coins\"[5] as well as two kilns stands found in 1829 (today held in Marischal Museum, Aberdeen).[21]\nIn 1740 \"a man who drove his spade through the panel of a door was immediately suffocated\"[7] having got caught in the sand and at an unknown date, a \"well-made causeway was discovered at the foot of the mound under which the Castle is said to be buried.\"[7]\n1985-1989 Excavations\nThorough excavations at Castlehill in 1985-1989 revealed the remains of the stone castle and traces of the previous timber one.[5] Traces of the stone castle revealed a \"perimeter wall\".. and \"two mural buildings\".[5] It also ascertained that the later stone castle was approximately \"20m by 6.5 m\"[5] and \"divided into three parts, a central room, and two smaller end rooms\".[5] It likely supported more than one storey, due to the \"indication of a possible forestair\"... and \"the wall thickness.\"[5]\nThe results of this excavation can be found in the Journal article (available free from the link in the journal citation below) \"Excavations at Rattray, Aberdeenshire.

    "text": "Historic site\nSlains Castle (otherwise known as Old Slains Castle) is a ruined castle near Collieston in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is not to be confused with New Slains Castle, a separate building located five miles (eight kilometres) northeast. Built in the 13th century, it was partly destroyed in 1594.\nHistory\nThe 13th-century castle was originally the property of the Comyn, Earl of Buchan. After the forfeiture of the Comyns in the 14th century it was given to Sir Gilbert Hay by Robert the Bruce in recognition for his support against the English.[1]\nSlains Castle next comes into prominence when Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll took part in a Catholic Rebellion in the north of Scotland. King James VI came to Abedeen in April 1589 and placed a garrison of soldiers at Slains Castle.[2] In January 1593, the Earl of Erroll was said to have welcomed so many English and Scottish Catholics in a tower at Slains that he was put to great expense.[3] The rebellion culminated in the Battle of Glenlivet in 1594, which left the Catholic army substantially weakened, and the rebellion collapsed. James VI marched north with an army intent on capturing the leaders of the rebellion, including Francis Hay, however they evaded capture.[4] He then proceeded to blow up their castles, including Old Slains Castle. At the king's request, Aberdeen Council provided 20 stone (130 kilograms) weight of gunpowder together with pickaxes and other tools, required for ‘demolishing and casting down of houses and fortalices to the sum of 548 pounds six shillings’.[5] The castle was destroyed with gunpowder and cannon on 1 November.[6] Aberdeen town council sent the stonemason John Fraser and other workmen to the demolition work at Huntly Castle and Slains, equipped with new shovels.[7] Two walls meeting at a corner survived the explosion. (Old) Slains Castle. What remains after it was blown up with gunpowder in 1594. Next year, Elizabeth Douglas, Countess of Erroll, a friend of Anne of Denmark, hired masons to repair the building.[8] However, it was beyond saving. She then moved into the farmhouse of Clochtow, 1⁄2 mile (800 metres) northwest of the ruined castle. She remained in this ‘mean abode, and continued there sometime after 1597, when the honours and estates were restored... The Countess, all her remaining days, preferred to her noble title of Countess of Erroll the plain designation of “Guidwife of Clochtow”, because this designation had never been taken by the crown from her, and she had been known by it during the period of her husband’s exile, when he was a wanderer abroad, and only plain “Francis Hay”.’[9] Francis Hay later built a tower house called Bowness on what is now the site of New Slains Castle.[10]\nStructure\nOriginally a strongly built 5-storey oblong keep (of which a small part remains), a wall defending the landward side was added in the early 16th century.\nModern day\nTwo sections of wall remain standing, at approximately 25 metres (82 ft) in height. The south-facing wall partially collapsed on 31 May 1979. An estimated 100 tons of rubble fell on the road next to the castle, blocking the road and partially burying a lorry.[11] In the 1950s, a 3-storey house was built within the ruins, adjoining a fishing cottage built in the 18th century. Since 1991 several archaeological excavations have been carried out, the last one in 2007.[1][citation needed] The remains of the old castle are designated as a scheduled ancient monument.[1]\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAitken, Margaret.

    "text": "Former castle near Helensburgh\nArdencaple Castle, also known as Ardincaple Castle, and sometimes referred to as Ardencaple Castle Light, is a listed building, situated about 1 statute mile (1.6 km) from Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute, Scotland.[2][3] Today, all that remains of the castle is a tower, perched on the edge of a plateau, looking down on a flat tract of land between it and the shore of the Firth of Clyde.[4] The original castle was thought to have been built sometime in the 12th century,[5] and part of the remains of the original castle were said to have existed in the 19th century.[2] Today, that sole remaining tower is used as a navigational aid for shipping on the Firth of Clyde. Because of its use as a lighthouse the tower has been called Ardencaple Castle Light.[6]\nLairds of Ardincaple\nThe word Ardencaple or Ardincaple has been said to be derived from the Gaelic Ard na gCapull, meaning \"cape of the horses\", or \"of the mares\", or \"height of the horses\".[7][8] In 1351 this place name was recorded as Airdendgappil.[7] From the Middle Ages the lands of Ardencaple were controlled by the Lairds of Ardincaple. By the late 15th century or 16th century the lairds had adopted the surname MacAulay. By this time the Laird of Ardincaple was considered the clan chief of Clan MacAulay.\nThe fortunes of the Lairds of Ardincaple failed in the 18th century, and they were forced to divide and sell, piece by piece, the lands of Ardincaple and their other estates to pay debts. Archibald MacAulay, 9th laird (died 1752), began the process around 1700,[9] and the sales continued under his sons - one of whom wrote a primer on shorthand in an effort to raise money.[10] By the time the 12th laird died around 1767, the roof had fallen in and the overall condition of the castle had deteriorated to such an extent that he had been forced to abandon his residence there and live in nearby Laggarie, having completed the sale of the MacAulay estates.[9]\nRenovations to the Ardincaple Estate\nSketch by Robert Adam of his planned addition to Ardincaple Castle in 1774.\nThe estate was then purchased by John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll,[11] and remained in possession of the Campbells well into the 19th century. It was during the Campbell's tenure as lairds of Ardencaple in the 18th century that extensive development was done on the estate by Robert Adam - Scotland's foremost architect of the time. In 1764, while the house was in possession of Lord Frederick Campbell, Robert Adam was first consulted about work on the castle. The house was then irregularly shaped, and Adam came up with a plan for the addition of castle-style additions on the western side of the house which faced the Gare Loch. However, nothing came of this scheme and it wasn't until 1774 that Adam came up with a set of drawings for an addition to the southern half of the west front of the house. This addition was made up of three-bay-windowed, D-shaped tower set in between two smaller turrets (pictured left). Later photographs of Ardincaple Castle show that Adam's extension had been altered or that some features present in his sketch were omitted from being implemented. For instance, the conical roofs, the crow-stepped gable in the sketch do not appear in photographs of the castle. Photographs of Ardincaple Castle show that the tower and southern turret had one more storey than appear in Adam's sketch According to David King, it is possible that Adam was responsible for the added extra floor to the tower, but that is it very unlikely Adam altered the turret because the altered turret broke the symmetry of the addition. Also, Adam had planned that the tower would contain a D-shaped dressing room on its main floor (upper floor). However, it was later decided to make the room oval shaped. David King remarks that Adam had planned a pleasant ceiling for this room, but that there is no sign of it in photographs of 1957.[12] George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll was born at Ardencaple Castle on 30 April 1823.[13] By 1852 the Duchess Dowager of Argyll sold the Ardencaple estate to the wealthy Colquhouns of Luss.[14] Ardencaple Castle Light. Today the tower is used as a navigational aid for shipping on the Firth of Clyde. Photo by Robie Macauley.\nModern era and destruction of the castle\nIn 1923, Sir Iain Colquhoun sold the castle to Mrs. H. Macaulay-Stromberg,[15] a wealthy American, who restored the castle and lived there until her death, in 1931.[16] The castle then passed to Adelaide Parker Voorheis until 1935,[16] when it passed to a consortium of developers who had constructed, in 1936-1937 a housing estate on what used to be the Tower Lawn.[16] The castle then was requisitioned by the Royal Navy[16] with the outbreak of World War II.\nIn 1957 most of the castle was demolished by the government in order to build naval housing for the nearby HMNB Clyde (Faslane Naval Base & Royal Naval Armaments Depot, Coulport), though one tower was left to be used as a mount for navigational beacons and transit lights for the Royal Navy.[17] From then on, the 45-foot (14 m) high tower was known as \"Ardencaple Castle Range Rear Light\", and had two green lights mounted on its south-west corner.[1] Ardencaple Castle has been considered a Category B listed building since 14 May 1971.[3] Today, all that remains of the grand turreted mansion is one solitary tower.\nGallery\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Ardencaple Castle.

    "text": "Aros Castle, also known as Dounarwyse Castle, is a ruined 13th-century castle near Salen on the Isle of Mull, Scotland. The castle overlooks the Sound of Mull.\nHistory\nThe castle was probably built by one of the MacDougall lords of Lorn in the 13th century. Documentary evidence from the late 14th century records it as Dounarwyse Castle in the possession of the Lords of the Isles. The castle was initially a stronghold of the Clan MacDougall. When they backed the losing side in the dispute between Edward I and Robert de Bruys, their lands were declared forfeit and the castle was given by King Robert to Angus Og of Islay Lord of the Isles and Clan Donald. During the late 14th and 15th centuries, it was used as an occasional base by the Lords of the Isles, at which time it was known as Dounarwyse Castle. When, some centuries later, the latter tried to conquer Scotland, they too had their lands declared forfeit, and this time Clan Maclean gained the Castle at MacDonald expense.\nLord Ochiltree entertained the Island Chiefs here in 1608 before making them prisoners. It was described as 'ruinous, old, useless and never of any strength' in 1688 but seems to have been garrisoned by Argyll's troops in 1690. No evidence exists of any occupation in the 18th century or later.\nStatus\nIt is a scheduled monument that includes the 13th-century hall-house and bailey with traces of other buildings, possibly of a later date, and a small stone-built galley landing east of the bailey.[1] References\nRoyal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland listing - Aros Castle, CANMORE\nMike Salter, Castles of Western and Northern Scotland 1995\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

The castle dates back to the 13th century and is the seat of Clan MacLean.[1] One source states that the castle was \"brought back from ruin in 1911\".[2] The regimental colours of the WW1 Canadian Expeditionary Force 236th Battalion (New Brunswick Kilties), CEF are laid up in the Great Hall.\nHistory\nDuart Castle was probably built by Clan MacDougall in the 13th century, and appears to have come into the hands of Clan MacLean in the following century.[3]\nIn 1350, Lachlan Lubanach Maclean of Duart, the 5th Clan Chief, married Mary Macdonald, daughter of John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, and Duart was part of her dowry.[4] John of Islay's son, Donald Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, confirmed the castle by charter to the Macleans in 1390.\nIn 1647, Duart Castle was attacked and laid siege to by the Argyll government troops of Clan Campbell, but they were defeated and driven off by the Royalist troops of Clan MacLean.\nIn September 1653, a Cromwellian task force of six ships anchored off the castle, but the Macleans had already fled to Tiree. A storm blew up on the 13 September and three ships were lost, including Swan. To the north of the castle is a Historic Marine Protected Area within which lie the remains of a wrecked 17th century warship, believed to be the Swan.[5]\nIn 1678, the 9th Earl of Argyll, Chief of Clan Campbell and son of the late Marquess of Argyll, successfully invaded the Clan MacLean lands on the Isle of Mull and Sir John Maclean, 4th Baronet, fled the castle and withdrew to Cairnbulg Castle, and afterward to Kintail under the protection of the 3rd Earl of Seaforth.[6]\nIn 1691, Duart Castle was surrendered by Sir John Maclean, 4th Baronet, to the 10th Earl of Argyll (who was later created, in 1701, the 1st Duke of Argyll).[1] The Campbell clan partially demolished the castle, and the stones from the walls were scattered. The 5th Laird of Torloisk used some of the stones to build a cottage for his family close to the site of the castle.[7]\nBy 1751 the remains of the castle were abandoned.[8]\nDescendants of the 1st Duke of Argyll sold the castle in 1801, to MacQuarrie, who then sold it to Carter-Campbell of Possil who kept it as a ruin within the grounds of his own estate to the north, Torosay Castle. He later sold his Torosay Estate, which now included the ruins of Castle Duart, to A. C. Guthrie in 1865. On 11 September 1911, the ruin was separated from the rest of the Torosay Estate and was bought by Sir Fitzroy Donald Maclean, the 26th Chief of the Clan MacLean, and restored.[1][9][10]\nBy 2012, additional restorations were required and a fund was set up to accept donations for this purpose. Phase 7 of the project was underway in 2020.[11]\nLairds of Duart\nLairds are owners of an estate.\nLachlan Lubanach Maclean, 5th Chief, 1st laird of Duart, it was part of his wife's dowry.[4]\nRed Hector of the Battles Maclean, 6th Chief, 2nd laird of Duart.\nLachlan Bronneach Maclean, 7th Chief, 3rd laird of Duart.\nLachlan Og Maclean, 8th Chief, 4th laird of Duart.\nHector Odhar Maclean, 9th Chief, 5th laird of Duart.\nLachlan Maclean, 10th Chief, 6th laird of Duart.\nLachlan Cattanach Maclean, 11th Chief, 7th laird of Duart.\nHector Mor Maclean, 12th Chief (1497–1568), 8th laird of Duart.\nHector Og Maclean, 13th Chief, 9th laird of Duart.\nLachlan Mor Maclean, 14th Chief, 10th laird of Duart.\nSir Hector Og Maclean, 15th Chief, 11th laird of Duart.\n...\nSir John Maclean, 4th Baronet, 16th Laird of Duart.

In the winter of 2013–14 the castle lost four ceilings, which were brought down by water penetration through the chimneys. In July 2014, a restoration appeal was launched.[12]\nFilm location\nThe castle was used as a location in the 1945 film I Know Where I'm Going! (as \"Castle of Sorne\"). It was also featured in the 1971 film When Eight Bells Toll, starring Anthony Hopkins and in the 1999 film Entrapment, starring Sean Connery (who has MacLean ancestry on his mother's side) and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\nIt is also the setting for the base of Buffy Summers in the first half of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight.[citation needed]\nLighthouse\nTo the south east of the castle is the Duart Point lighthouse.

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunaverty_Castle",
    "text": "\"Dunaverty\" redirects here. For heritage-listed house in Brisbane, Australia, see Dunaverty, Albion.\nHistoric site\nDunaverty Castle is located at Southend at the southern end of the Kintyre peninsula in western Scotland. The site was once a fort belonging to the Clan Donald (MacDonald). Little remains of the castle,[1] although the site is protected as a scheduled monument.[2]\nHistory\nThe remains of Dunaverty Castle stand on a rocky head land on the south east corner of Kintyre, Scotland. The headland it was built on forms a natural stronghold with the sea on three sides and is only approachable from the north. It is attached to the mainland only by a narrow path. It is known that the castle itself was accessed by a drawbridge.\n13th century\nIn 1248, Henry III, King of England allowed Walter Byset to buy stores from Ireland for Dunaverty Castle which he had seized and was fortifying, apparently in revenge for hospitality given by Alexander II, King of Scotland to certain English pirates. However during that same year the castle was taken by Allan, the son of the Earl of Atholl, and Byset was taken prisoner.\nIn 1263, Dunaverty Castle was garrisoned by Alexander III, King of Scotland during the Norwegian campaign of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway.\nThe castle was eventually surrendered to the Norwegian king, who in turn granted it to Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí, one of his steadfast supporters in the Hebrides. With the evaporation of Norwegian sovereignty in the Hebrides after 1263, Alexander III appears to have retaken the castle.[3]\n14th century\nLate in 1306, the embattled Robert I, King of Scotland seems to have fled to the safety of Dunaverty Castle and his friend, Aonghus Óg Mac Domhnaill, the Lord of the Isles. According to The Bruce, the king was harboured there for three days by Aonghus Óg Mac Domhnaill, before Aonghus took him to Rathlin Island. Some contemporary sources suggest that the castle was already under the king's control, however, and that the king acquired it from a certain Maol Coluim in March. In September of that year, when the English arrived at the castle, the Scottish king was not to be found.\n15th century\nIn 1493 the fourth and last Lord of the Isles forfeited his title to James IV, King of Scotland. By 1494 the king had garrisoned and provisioned Dunaverty Castle. It is said that the MacDonalds, led by Sir John MacDonald whom the king had recently knighted, retook the castle before the King had even departed to Stirling and that the dead body of the King's castle governor was hung over the castle walls in sight of the King and his departing entourage. Sir John Macdonald however was later captured by MacIain of Ardnamurchan. He was tried and hanged on the Burgh Muir near Edinburgh.\n16th century\nThe castle was repaired by the crown between 1539 and 1542. In January 1544, a Commission in Queen Mary's name was given to the captain, constable and keeper of the Castle of Dunaverty, to deliver it with its artillery and ammunition to the Earl of Argyll and in April of that year Argyll received a 12-year tack of North and South Kintyre, including the castle.\nThe English raided Kintyre and Campbeltown Loch in October 1588 because of the activities of the Clan MacDonald in Ireland. The Earl of Sussex sailed from Dublin in the Mary Willoughby with a small fleet and burnt Saddell, Dunaverty and Machrimore. He then burnt farms on Arran, Bute, and Cumbrae.[4]\n17th century\nIn 1626, the Lordship of Kintyre was reconstituted in favour of the Earl of Argyll and Dunaverty Castle was denoted as its principal messuage. Argyll bestowed the Lordship of Kintyre on James, his eldest son by his second marriage, who, in 1635, at Dunaverty, granted a charter of the Lordship to Viscount Dunluce, eldest son of Randal MacDonnell, 1st Earl of Antrim. The transfer was set aside by the Scottish Privy Council, no doubt on a complaint by Argyll's eldest son, the Marquis of Lorn, who had bitterly resented his father's bestowal of the Lordship on his younger half-brother. On 12 December 1636, Lorn received a charter, under the Great Seal, of the Lordship of Kintyre, with the Castle of Dunaverty as its principal messuage.\nDuring the Civil War Dunaverty was besieged in 1647 by Scottish supporters of Oliver Cromwell who were led by General David Leslie (Leslie later became a Royalist). The MacDonalds surrendered and then 300 of them were massacred. This incident became known as the Battle of Dunaverty, or \"Dunaverty Massacre\". The castle is nothing more than a ruin now, known as Blood Rock for the massacre which took place there.\nSee also\nScottish castles\nCitations\nReferences\nBarrow, GWS (1981).

The Irish annals record that \"Dun Ollaigh\" was attacked or burned down three times, in 686, 698, and in 701.[1] It was subsequently rebuilt in 714 by Selbach mac Ferchair (died 730), the King of Dál Riata credited with destroying the site in 701.[1][2] Excavations in the 1970s suggest that this early fortification was abandoned some time in the 10th century.[3]\nThe area around Dunollie subsequently became part of the semi-independent Kingdom of the Isles, ruled over by Somerled in the 12th century. On his death the MacDougalls became Lords of Lorne.[2] Dougall, Somerled's son, held most of Argyll and also the islands of Mull, Lismore, Jura, Tiree, Coll and many others in the 12th century.\nExcavations show that Dunollie was refortified with an earthwork castle in the 13th century or potentially the late 12th century. The builder may have been Dougall, or his son Duncan.[4] Ewan MacDougall, great-grandson of Somerled and the third chief of the MacDougalls, switched the clan's allegiance in the mid 13th century: initially allied with Haakon IV of Norway, from the 1250s Ewan remained loyal to the kings of Scotland.\nIn the 14th century Ewan's grandson John MacDougall, along with his kinsmen the Comyns, sided with the Balliols against the interests of Robert the Bruce. John MacDougall's army defeated the Bruce at the Battle of Dalrigh in 1306, but Bruce returned in 1308 and crushed the MacDougalls at the Battle of the Pass of Brander. The MacDougall lands of Lorne were subsequently forfeit and were given to the Campbells, though Dunollie and other estates were regained later in the 14th century.\nDunollie Castle - painting by Sir George Reid\nThe existing castle ruins date largely from the 15th century.[5]\nThe Marquis of Argyll captured the castle in 1644, but it was returned to the MacDougalls in 1661. In 1746, the MacDougalls abandoned Dunollie Castle and built Dunollie House just downhill from the castle ruins.\nIn recent years, a charitable trust was formed titled The MacDougall of Dunollie Preservation Trust, who are responsible for the care of the historic buildings and collections held in this an ancestral site. Today, the Dunollie Preservation Trust operates Dunollie Museum, Castle & Grounds - a visitor attractions and social enterprise. Through the running of this organisation, all funds raised contribute to ongoing conservation and development efforts as well as education and learning.[6] Remains of a historical herb garden have recently been discovered in the castle grounds.\nGallery Dunollie Castle Oban, Dunollie Castle Dunollie Castle - May 2016\nSee also\nRoyalist rising of 1651 to 1654\nDunstaffnage Castle\nReferences\nSources\nAlcock, Leslie; Alcock, Elizabeth A (1987). \"Reconnaissance excavations on early historic fortifications and other royal sites in Scotland, 1974-84: 2, Excavations at Dunollie Castle, Oban, Argyll, 1978\" (PDF).

    "text": "Castle in Argyll and Bute, Scotland\nDunoon Castle is a ruined castle in Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, Scotland. The castle sat upon a cone-shaped hill about 80 feet (24 m) high. Very little remains of the castle's structure today. Castle House, built in 1822, stands a few yards north of the castle ruins.[1]\nThe remains of the castle, and a surrounding area, are a scheduled monument.[2][3]\nThe castle was a royal residence in the 14th century, and in the 17th century fell into ruins.[4]\n13th–15th century\nDunoon Castle engraving by William Miller after W Brown\nDunoon Castle Entrance\nThe castle is first recorded in the thirteenth century.[5] It may have been constructed in the context of the Stewarts increasing authority in Cowal.[6]\nIn 1333 Dunoon Castle was besieged and taken by Edward Balliol, who surrendered it to Edward III of England.[7] An insurrection ensued, driving Baliol out of Scotland. Robert the Steward, later King Robert II of Scotland, arrived in Cowal and, with the help of Colin Campbell of Lochow, retook the castle.[8]\nJames III undertook to repay his Master of Household, Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll for repairs to the castle in 1468, and made him keeper of the castle in 1472.[9] By the 15th century it was a royal castle with the Campbells as hereditary keepers.[5]\n16th century\nIn 1544 Dunoon Castle was besieged by Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox. Having eighteen ships and 800 soldiers provided by Henry VIII of England, Lennox succeeded in taking the Castles of Dunoon and Rothesay. Archibald Campbell, 4th Earl of Argyll, was driven out, sustaining great loss.[10]\nIn 1563, Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed at the castle while visiting her half-sister, Jean Stewart, Countess of Argyll, and granted several charters during her visit.[11] Mary's rebels met up at Dunoon during the Chaseabout Raid. Her brother the Earl of Moray's faction in Argyll included the Duke of Châtelherault, and the Earls of Argyll and Rothes. They left for Ayrshire on 18 August 1565.[12]\n17th century\nIn 1646 occurred the Dunoon massacre in which the Campbells slaughtered men, women, children, and infants of Clan Lamont.[13] After the restoration of the episcopacy under Charles II, Dunoon became the residence of the bishops of Argyll for a time.[14]\nThe castle was destroyed during the Earl of Argyll's rebellion against James VII and II in 1685.\n20th century\nDuring World War I and II, military fortifications were established at Dunoon Castle for the defense of the River Clyde and the shipbuilding industry.[15]\nReferences\nExternal links\nMap sources for Dunoon Castle\nVisit Scotland webpage for Dunoon Castle\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, UK\nDunstaffnage Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Caisteal Dhùn Stadhainis) is a partially ruined castle in Argyll and Bute, western Scotland. It lies 3 miles (5 km) NNE of Oban, situated on a platform of conglomerate rock on a promontory at the south-west of the entrance to Loch Etive, and is surrounded on three sides by the sea.[1] The castle and the nearby chapel ruin have been a Historic Scotland property since 1958.[2] Both are Scheduled Ancient Monuments.[3][4]\nThe castle dates back to the 13th century, making it one of Scotland's oldest stone castles, in a local group which includes Castle Sween and Castle Tioram.[5] Guarding a strategic location, it was built by the MacDougall lords of Lorn, and has been held since the 15th century by the Clan Campbell. To this day there is a hereditary Captain of Dunstaffnage, although they no longer reside at the castle. Dunstaffnage is maintained by Historic Environment Scotland, and is open to the public, although the 16th century gatehouse is retained as the private property of the Captain. The prefix dun in the name means \"fort\" in Gaelic, while the rest of the name derives from Norse stafr-nis, \"headland of the staff\".\nHistory\nBefore Dunstaffnage\nBefore the construction of the castle, Dunstaffnage may have been the location of a Dál Riatan stronghold, known as Dun Monaidh, as early as the 7th century.[6] It was recorded, by John Monipennie in 1612, that the Stone of Destiny was kept here after being brought from Ireland, and before it was moved to Scone Palace in 843. However, Iona and Dunadd are considered more likely, given their known connections with Dál Riatan and Strathclyde kings.[7] Hector Boece records that the stone was kept at \"Evonium\", which has traditionally been identified with Dunstaffnage, although in 2010 the writer A. J. Morton identified Evonium with Irvine in Ayrshire.[8]\nThe MacDougalls\nThere was a castle here in the time of Somerled, Lord of the Isles.[9] However, the castle became the seat of Duncan MacDougall, Lord of Lorn and grandson of Somerled in the second quarter of the 13th century.[10] He had also travelled to Rome in 1237 and was the founder of nearby Ardchattan Priory.[11] Duncan's son Ewen MacDougall inherited his father's title in the 1240s, and expanded the MacDougall influence, styling himself \"King of the Isles\" though that title belonged to the MacDonalds. It is probable that Ewen built the three round towers onto the castle, and constructed and enlarged the hall inside.[12]\nFollowing Alexander III's repulse of the Norse influence in Argyll, the MacDougalls backed the Scottish monarchy, and Ewen's son Alexander was made the first sheriff of Argyll in 1293. However, they supported the Balliol side during the Wars of Scottish Independence which broke out a few years later. Robert Bruce defeated the Clan MacDougall at the Battle of the Pass of Brander in August 1308. After a brief siege, King Robert took control of the MacDougall castle of Dunstaffnage.[13] He did not destroy it, as he did others, but appointed a constable and provisioned it, thinking to use it to guard the countryside and seaways. With the land he gave his friend, Angus Og Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, that included much of the MacDougall lands, including nearby Mull, the castle could be well used for that purpose by the Isleman.\nRoyal fortress\nNow a Crown property, Dunstaffnage was controlled by a series of keepers. James I seized the castle in 1431, following the Battle of Inverlochy, as his enemies were hiding inside. In 1455 James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas stayed at Dunstaffnage, on his way to treat with John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles.[14] This followed James II's attack on Douglas power, and led to the signing of the Treaty of Westminster-Ardtornish. A later keeper, John Stewart of Lorn, was a rival of Alan MacDougall, and was stabbed by his supporters on his way to his marriage at Dunstaffnage Chapel in 1463, although he survived long enough to make his vows. Although MacDougall took the castle, he was ousted by James III, who granted Dunstaffnage to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll in 1470.[15]\nThe south facade of Dunstaffnage Castle\nClan Campbell\nThe Earls of Argyll appointed Captains to oversee Dunstaffnage, and keep it in readiness, on their behalf. Changes were made to the buildings, particularly the gatehouse, which was rebuilt around this time. The Campbells were loyal allies of the royal house, and Dunstaffnage was used as a base for government expeditions against the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, among others, during the 15th and 16th centuries. James IV visited Dunstaffnage on two occasions.[14]\nDunstaffnage saw action during the Civil War, holding out against Montrose's army in 1644. The castle was burned by royalist troops, following the failure of Argyll's Rising in 1685, against the Catholic James VII.[16] During the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745, the castle was occupied by government troops. Flora MacDonald, who helped Bonnie Prince Charlie to escape from Scotland, was briefly imprisoned here while en route to imprisonment in London.[14]\nAccording to W. Douglas Simpson the castle appears in Tobias Smollet's Humphry Clinker, which although not naming Dunstaffnage, presents \"a fair picture of life in the castle in the third quarter of the eighteenth century\".[17]\nDecline and restoration\nThe Campbells continued to add to the castle, building a new house over the old west range in 1725. However, the rest of the castle was already decaying. In 1810 an accidental fire gutted the gatehouse, and the Captains ceased to live here, moving to Dunstaffnage House some 2 km to the south-east.[14] Tenants lived in the 1725 house within the castle until 1888.[18]\nRestoration work was undertaken in 1903 by the Duke of Argyll, the castle's owner. This was followed in 1912 by a court case, in which the Court of Session ruled that Angus Campbell, the 20th hereditary Captain, had right of residence notwithstanding the Duke of Argyll's ownership. Works were delayed by World War I, and the planned total restoration was never completed.[19] In 1958, the 21st Captain and the Duke agreed to hand the castle into state care,[18] and it is now open to the public as a Historic Environment Scotland property.[3][4]\nDescription\nPlans of Dunstaffnage Castle\nWalls\nDunstaffnage is an irregular quadrangular structure of great strength, with rounded towers at three of the angles. It measures approximately 35 by 30 metres (115 by 98 ft), and has a circumference of about 120 metres (390 ft). The walls are of coursed rubble, with sandstone dressings, and stand up to 18 m (60 ft) high, including the conglomerate bedrock platform. The walls are up to 3 m (10 ft) thick, affording strong defence to this highly strategic location, guarding the entrance to Loch Etive and the Pass of Brander beyond, and today commanding a splendid view. The parapet walk, which once followed the whole of the walls, has been partially restored with new stone flags. The original parapet is now also gone. Arrow slits, later converted into gunloops, are the only openings. Brass cannon recovered from wrecked vessels of the Spanish Armada were once mounted on the walls.[1]\nRound towers\nSoon after the construction of the castle walls, three round towers were built on the north, east, and west towers. The north tower, or donjon, is the largest, comprising three or four storeys originally, and probably housed the lord's private apartments.[20] The west tower is almost internal, barely projecting beyond the rounded corner of the curtain wall, and could only be entered via the parapet walk. The basement level contains a pit prison which was accessed from above. The east tower was almost completely rebuilt in the late 15th century as a gatehouse. Each tower was probably once topped by a conical roof.[21]\nThe gatehouse, with the remains of the north-east hall range to the left\nThe gatehouse\nThe gatehouse was built by the Campbells in the late 15th century, replacing an earlier round tower in the east corner. It takes the form of a four-storey harled tower house, with the entrance passage running through half the vaulted basement, the other half forming guard rooms with arrow slits facing the gate. The present approach to the gate is by a stone stair, replacing an earlier drawbridge.[22] The tower was remodelled in the 18th century to provide reception rooms and a private suite. The dormer windows at the top are capped by the pediments from the 1725 house (see below), and bear the date, the Campbell arms, and the initials AEC and DLC, for Aeneas Campbell, 11th Captain, and his wife Dame Lilias. The pediments were moved here during the 1903 restoration works.[23]\nInternal ranges\nThe north-west range of 1725, with the gatehouse on the right, seen from the parapet walk\nThe east range was located between the north and east towers, although only foundations remain. This was the principal range of buildings and contained a large hall above vaulted cellars.[24] The hall had double-lancet windows, decorated with carved patterns, which were later blocked up; their outlines can be seen in the east curtain wall.\nA second range stood along the north-west wall, and would have been connected to the hall range by the donjon tower. The ground floor housed a kitchen. In 1725 the range was remodelled into a two-storey house, accessed via a stone stair, and topped with the dormer windows which now form part of the gatehouse. The well in front is original, although the large stone surround is of 19th century date.[25]\nEast end of Dunstaffnage Chapel, showing the lancet windows and the Campbell burial aisle beyond\nDunstaffnage Chapel\nA ruined chapel lies around 150 metres (490 ft) to the south-west of the castle. This was also built by Duncan MacDougall of Lorn, as a private chapel, and features detailed stonework of outstanding quality. Experts believe that the chapel was built in the second quarter of the 13th century. The chapel is 20 by 6 metres (66 by 20 ft), and formerly had a timber roof. The lancet windows carry dog-tooth carving, and have fine wide-splayed arches internally. The chapel was already ruinous in 1740, when a burial aisle was built on to the east end, to serve as a resting place for the Campbells of Dunstaffnage.[26][27]\nCaptain of Dunstaffnage\nTraditionally, an officer called the Hereditary Captain of Dunstaffnage is responsible for the castle and its defence. The office still exists, and to retain the title (now rather a sinecure without military significance), the incumbent is required to spend three nights a year in the castle. No other responsibilities or privileges now attach to the post.\nCastle ghost\nA ghost, known as the \"Ell-maid of Dunstaffnage\", is said to haunt the castle. A type of gruagach, the ghost's appearances are said to be associated with events in the lives of the hereditary keepers.[14]\nNotes\nDunstaffnage Castle, 1836 engraving by William Miller after J. M.

    "text": "Castle in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, UK\nRuins of Dunyvaig Castle\nDunyvaig Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Naomhaig, Anglicised Fort of the galleys, also known as Dunnyveg)[1] is located on the south side of Islay, in Argyll, Scotland, on the shore of Lagavulin Bay, 4 kilometres (2+1⁄2 miles) from Port Ellen.[1] The castle was once a naval base of the Lord of the Isles, chiefs of Clan Donald. It was held by the chiefs of the Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg.\nHistory\n12th century\nA castle was built by Somerled, King of the Isles, on top of a fort or dun on a rocky promontory jutting into Lagavulin Bay.\n13th and 14th centuries\nThe castle was held by the Macdonalds, Lords of the Isles, Somerled's descendants, specifically, Angus Mor Macdonald and his sons, Alexander Og and Angus Og. They used Lagavulin Bay as an anchorage for their fleet of galleys.\n15th and 16th centuries\nForfeited in 1493, the castle passed to the MacIans of Ardnamurchan.[2] The MacIans were descended from John Macdonald, younger brother of Angus Og Macdonald, Lord of the Isles and friend of Robert the Bruce, and suffered when that clan was punished for the 1501-1506 insurrection of Black Donald; the castle was transferred to a branch of the Campbells. In 1545, however, the MacDonald holdings in Islay and Jura were restored to them.[2]\nMary, Queen of Scots planned a visit to Argyll in June 1563. Agnes Campbell, the wife of James MacDonald of Dunyvaig, gave the queen a \"marvellous fair\" costume of \"Hyeland apparell\".[3] In 1598 the castle was kept by John Stewart of Arskok who was given £3000 Scots yearly for the expenses.[4]\n17th century\nAngus MacDonald, 8th of Dunnyveg surrendered the castle by negotiation to the king's lieutenant Andrew Stuart, 3rd Lord Ochiltree and the Bishop of the Isles Andrew Knox who brought a royal naval force with 1000 men on 2 August 1608. On 5 August Angus MacDonald and others came aboard the Advantage to celebrate Gowrie day, the anniversary of the rescue of James VI of Scotland at Perth in 1600. A garrison loyal to the king was installed.[5]\nIn 1614, the castle was taken by Ranald Og Macdonald, however it was retaken by Angus Og MacDonald, who attempted to bargain the castle's surrender. Knox attempted to retake the castle in September 1614 and was defeated and compelled to retreat. Knox left his son Thomas and his nephew John Knox of Ranfurly as hostages for his good faith.\nKnox wrote to the lawyer Thomas Hamilton explaining these events and his actions after accusations that his inaction and sloth had led to the capture of the castle by the MacDonalds. He said his negotiation for the castle's surrender had stalled, and he had found it difficult to hire boats to take him from Arran to Dunyvaig during the harvest time. The MacLeans and McLeods of Harris refused to serve with him, and he could raise no more than seventy men, of whom fifty were waged soldiers and twenty followers of the lairds of Ardincaple and Ranfurly. When he landed on Islay, lacking any further armed support, the Clan Donald of Islay, outmanoeuvred him and cut him off from his boats, which they looted and destroyed. The next day Knox was told he should surrender the two hostages or all his men would be executed. Knox noted that the MacDonalds had built a new fort in the loch. Some of his men had heard Angus Og MacDonald say he was working for the Earl of Argyll, who would give him the castle and the whole lands of Islay.[6] Thomas Hamilton wrote to Knox, who was at Brodick Castle offering the services of the Earl of Caithness and his cannon, but noting it was too late in the year.[7]\nGeorge Graham negotiated the freedom of the two hostages or \"gentlemen prisoners\" although he lacked official support except a verbal promise from the Chancellor, Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline of a cash reward.[8] On 6 January 1615, Sir John Campbell of Calder, with the assistance of Sir Oliver Lambart who brought artillery and men in the Phoenix and retook the castle.[9] Lambert captured 22 men while 22 others including Coll Ciotach escaped from a postern gate into a longboat.[10]\nIn June 1615 Sir James MacDonald and Coll Ciotach captured the castle again, killing the captain and some of the garrison. The Privy Council of Scotland asked for a pinnace with cannon to batter the castle. Sir James MacDonald fled, and on 13 October 1615 before the guns were landed from the Charles and a barque Coll Ciotach surrendered to Argyll.[11]\nThe castle was seized in 1647 by the Covenanters and passed into the hands of the Campbells of Cawdor, who held it until 1677, when Sir Hugh Campbell pulled down the castle and moved to Islay House.[2]\nRuins\nToday all that remains of the castle are mainly the ruins of the sixteenth-century castle, although the site includes a thirteenth-century courtyard, and a fifteenth-century keep.[2] The site was designated as a scheduled monument in 1989.[12]\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Dunyvaig Castle.\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070622063122/http://www.highlandconnection.org/castles/dunnyvegcastle.html\n55°38′01″N 6°07′23″W / 55.63361°N 6.12306°W / 55.63361; -6.12306\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

The fortress was once a stronghold of Clan Campbell.\nThe castle and the island are jointly a designated scheduled monument.[1]\nHistory\nThe castle that stands on the wooded island of Innis Chonnell has thick outer walls.[2] It was the original stronghold of the Clan Campbell from possibly the eleventh century or earlier.[2] It was the seat of Cailean Mór (Sir Colin Campbell) who was killed fighting the Clan MacDougall at the Battle of Red Ford in 1296.[2] Later John MacDougall held the castle against Robert the Bruce in 1308.[2] Sir Colin Campbell's son, Sir Neil Campbell, married Bruce's sister, Mary, and Sir Neil fought for the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.[2] Innis Chonnel Castle was abandoned by the Campbells as their residence in the fifteenth century, but it was still used as a prison.[2] The young Domhnall Dubh (\"Black Donald\"), son of Aonghas Óg (Angus) and heir to the Lordship of the Isles, was imprisoned in the castle after the Battle of Bloody Bay, which took place off the coast of the Isle of Mull in 1484.[2] He escaped but after invading Badenoch in 1503 he was recaptured and imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle for forty years.[2] Innis Chonnell Castle was in ruins by the nineteenth century.[2]\nReferences\nExternal links\nRoyal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland listing - Innes Chonnel Castle Archived 19 October 2012 at the Wayback Machine, CANMORE\n56°15′24″N 5°16′03″W / 56.2568°N 5.2675°W / 56.2568; -5.2675\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothesay_Castle",
    "text": "Castle in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, UK\nRothesay Castle is a ruined castle in Rothesay, the principal town on the Isle of Bute, in western Scotland. Located at NS086646, the castle has been described as \"one of the most remarkable in Scotland\",[1] for its long history dating back to the beginning of the 13th century, and its unusual circular plan.\nThe castle comprises a huge curtain wall, strengthened by four round towers, together with a 16th-century forework, the whole surrounded by a broad moat. Built by the Stewart family, it survived Norse attacks to become a royal residence. Though falling into ruin after the 17th century, the castle was repaired by the Marquess of Bute before passing into state care in the 20th century.\nA paddle steamer named after the castle was constructed in 1816.\nThe early castle\nThe castle was built either by Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland (died 1204), or by his succeeding son Walter (died 1246). During Alan's tenure, the family added the Isle of Bute to their lordship.[2] A wooden castle was constructed first, but the stone circular curtain wall was in place by the 1230s, when the castle was attacked and taken by the Norwegian-backed fleet of Óspakr-Hákon, King of the Isles (died 1230). According to Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar, Óspakr's forces fought for three days to take the castle, breaking down part of the eastern wall by hewing the stone with their axes. This saga is the earliest recorded account of an assault on a Scottish castle.[3] In 1263, Rothesay was taken again by the Norwegian forces under Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway (died 1263) before the Battle of Largs. Although the Battle of Largs is called indecisive, Hákon's campaign was a failure, the Norse retreated, and it effectively ended Norwegian authority in western Scotland.\nThe early castle comprised only the roughly circular curtain wall, 2.7 m (9 ft) thick, 7.9 m (26 ft) high and around 42 m (138 ft) in diameter, built on a low mound, with a battlement on top accessed by open stairs.[4][5] The moat was connected to the sea, the shoreline then being closer to the north-east of the Castle than it is today. The broad crenellations can be made out within the walls, which were later raised. Holes in the upper wall would have supported a timber bretasche, a projecting structure serving as an extended battlement. This curtain wall was built of coursed ashlar, and had only two openings in its length. The main gate was an arched opening with a simple timber door. The second opening was a small postern gate in the west wall, later blocked.\nIn the later part of the 13th century, the castle was strengthened by the addition of four round towers, of which only the north-west survives intact. These three-storey towers had strong splayed bases, with arrow slits below the crenellated parapet. A portcullis was added to the main gate.\nWars of independence and the rise of the Stewarts\nDuring the Wars of Scottish Independence, Rothesay was held by the English, but was taken by Robert the Bruce in 1311. It then returned to English hands in 1334, before being taken again by the Scots. Following the accession of the Stewarts to the throne of Scotland in 1371, the castle became a favourite residence of kings Robert II and Robert III, who died here in 1406. Robert II granted the hereditary keepership of the castle to his son John, ancestor of the Earls and Marquesses of Bute. Robert III made his eldest son David Duke of Rothesay in 1401, beginning a tradition of honouring the heir to the throne of Scotland with this title. In 1462 the castle survived a siege by the forces of John of Islay, Earl of Ross and the last Lord of the Isles.\n16th and 17th centuries\nIn the early 16th century Rothesay Castle was strengthened again. Construction of a gatehouse keep, extending from the north of the curtain wall, began around the turn of the century, to provide more modern accommodation for James IV. The curtain wall itself was raised up to ten metres in height, the works continuing into the reign of James V. In 1527 the castle withstood another siege by the Master of Ruthven, which destroyed much of the burgh of Rothesay. In 1544, the castle fell to the Earl of Lennox, acting for the English during the so-called \"Rough Wooing\".\nThe forework is an L-plan structure, which jutted into the moat and was accessed by a drawbridge. The lower floor comprised a vaulted entrance tunnel running into the older castle courtyard. Above, the four-storey tower contained royal lodgings, and still bears the royal coat of arms above the door. Also in the early 16th century, a chapel was constructed inside the old castle. Simple in form, the chapel measured around 7 m (23 ft) by 14 m (45 ft), and is now the only surviving structure within the curtain wall.[4] The north-west tower was converted into a doocot, and is known as the \"Pigeon Tower\", due to the nest boxes built into the outside wall.\nEsmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, a favourite of James VI was compelled by the Ruthven Regime to leave Scotland. He went first to Dumbarton Castle, then stayed at Rothesay Castle in October 1582.[6]\nRothesay was garrisoned for the occupying forces of Oliver Cromwell, who invaded Scotland with his New Model Army in the early 1650s. On their departure in 1660, the troops partially dismantled the structure. What was left was burned by the supporters of Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll during his rising of 1685, in support of the Monmouth Rebellion against James VII.\nRepair and restoration\nThe vaulted entrance tunnel.\nFollowing a long period of neglect, the 2nd Marquess of Bute employed 70 men to excavate the ruins, clearing large amounts of rubbish from the castle in 1816–17. But it was not until the 1871 that work resumed and the ruins were stabilised.[7] The 3rd Marquess, a keen restorer of historic buildings, embarked upon a series of repairs and restorations, following surveys and advice from his regular architect William Burges. His \"restorations\" continued until 1900, and include the clearing and shaping of the moat, as well as the red sandstone additions to the forework, which reinstated the hall roof while significantly altering the character of the building.\nIn 1961 Rothesay Castle was given to the state, and is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.[8]\nThe castle is open to visitors year round. Fine views can be seen from the top of the walls over the town and back towards the mainland.\nNotes\n^ Lindsay (1986), p.412\n^ Barrow, Geoffrey Wallis Steuart (2004). \"Stewart family\".

    "text": "11th century castle in Scotland\nCastle Sween, also known as Caisteal Suibhne,[1] and Caistéal Suibhne,[2] is located on the eastern shore of Loch Sween, in Knapdale,[3] south of the forestry village of Achnamara on the west coast of Argyll, Scotland. Castle Sween is thought to be one of the earliest stone castles built in Scotland, having been built in the late 11th century.[4][3] The castle's towers were later additions to wooden structures which have since vanished.[3]\nHistory\nCastle Sween is the oldest stone castle in Scotland, built in the late 11th century by Suibhne, son of Hugh Anrahan, brother of the king of Ulster and High King of Ireland, from whom it takes its name Suibhne.[5]\nAs late as the thirteenth century, the MacSweens possessed the surrounding lands of Knapdale. However, by the second half of the century, these territories passed into the hands of the Stewart/Menteith family.[5]\nIn 1310, Edward II, King of England, granted John MacSween, and his brothers, the MacSweens' ancestral lands of Knapdale, provided that they oust John Menteith. It is possible that MacSween, and his claim to his family's lost Scottish homeland, may be the subject of the Gaelic poem Dál chabhlaigh ar Chaistéal Suibhne. If so, this poem may well refer to an expedition by MacSween to retake Castle Sween in about 1310.[5]\nIn 1323, after the death of John Menteith, the Lordship of Arran and Knapdale passed to his son and grandson. In 1376, half of Knapdale, which included the castle, passed into the possession of John MacDonald I, Lord of the Isles, by a grant from his father-in-law, Robert II, King of Scotland.[5]\nDuring the MacDonalds' century and a half of holding the castle, the castellans were first MacNeils and later MacMillans.[6]\nThe 16th century manuscript known as The Book of the Dean of Lismore includes the lament of Aithbhreac Inghean Coirceadal (f. 1460), which remains a highly important poem in Scottish Gaelic literature. Aithbhreac, after being widowed, composed a lament addressed to the rosary of her late husband, a Tacksman of Clan MacNeil and former constable of Castle Sween.[7]\nIn 1490, Castle Sween was granted to Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, by James IV, King of Scotland.[6]\nIn 1647, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Castle Sween was attacked and burnt by Alasdair MacColla and his Irish Confederate followers.[6]\nIn 1933, the castle was put in the care of the Historic Building and Monuments Directorate (HBMD).[8] Currently Castle Sween is under the protection of Historic Scotland.[8]\nConservation\nA 2018 report from Historic Environment Scotland noted that Castle Sween is at \"very high risk\" of coastal erosion due to climate change.[9]\nIn popular culture\nCastle Sween was featured in the 2021 Starz TV series Men in Kilts: A Roadtrip With Sam and Graham (from Outlander) episode 7 \"Clans and Tartans\".[10]\nCitations\nReferences\nArgyll: An Inventory of the Monuments.

Tarbert Castle was a strategic royal stronghold during the Middle Ages and one of three castles at Tarbert. The castle overlooks the harbour and although pre 14th century in construction, the tower dates back to 1494 and the visit of James IV to the Western Highlands.\nHistory\nIn 712, Tarbert was burned by King Selbach mac Ferchair of Cenél Loairn and of Dál Riata and in 731 by his son, Dúngal mac Selbaig.[1]\nKing Edward II of England handed control of the castle to the Scottish King John II de Balliol in 1292. A fortified structure was built in Tarbert during the 13th century. It was reinforced with the addition of an outer bailey and towers in the 1320s by Robert the Bruce. A tower house was added in the 16th century, which is the most noticeable part of the remains. The castle occupies high land above the village, providing views up Loch Fyne and beyond to the Firth of Clyde. This castle was captured from John MacDonald of Islay, Lord of the Isles by James IV of Scotland as part of his campaign to destroy the power of the Lords of the Isles in 1494. In 1687 the castle was involved in another skirmish when Walter Campbell of Skipness Castle seized it as a stronghold for Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll as part of actions in support of the Monmouth Rebellion in England.\nThere are only a couple of standing walls left.

    "text": "This article is about the Auchen Castle ruins. For the hotel and wedding venue, see Auchen Castle Hotel.\nAuchen Castle is a ruined 13th-century quadrangular castle situated near Moffat, Dumfries and Galloway. It was designated as a scheduled ancient monument in 1937.[1]\nHistory\nThe castle was probably built by the Kirkpatrick family in the early to mid-13th century, possibly to replace the nearby motte-and-bailey castle at Garpol Water and command the valley of the River Annan to the east and the ravine formed by Garpol Burn to the south. The first documentary evidence of the estate is from a charter from December 1306 in which Sir Roger de Kirkpatrick loans money to Sir Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford. After Kirkpatrick's death during the siege of Lochmaben Castle in 1313, the lands appear to have been transferred to Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, although it is unclear what happened to them after his death in 1332. By the 15th century, the castle was owned by the Douglasses of Morton, before later passing to the Johnstones of Corehead, possibly during King James II's campaign against the Douglasses.[1][2]\nIn its earliest form, the castle comprised a four-sided enclosure with the entrance on the north wall. It had a round bastion at the north west angle and a garderobe in the east curtain wall. The walls were protected by a broad ditch, except in the north where a causeway passed over a linked pair of fish ponds. The entrance was later reinforced by a dog-leg forework in the form of a pend. In the late 15th or early- to mid-16th century, the castle was adapted for use as an artillery fortification with the walls lowered and reinforced with masonry and earth.[2]\nAn inventory made of goods belonging to the deceased James Douglas of \"Auchencassill\" in October 1483 includes a folding table, a horse, a chalice and altar ornaments, a sword, a featherbed, bed curtains and canopy, and the hangings or apparelling of the hall, a cushion, a silver salt and spoon, kitchen ware, an eel crook, and other items. This selection was claimed by William Douglas of Drumlanrig as his heir.[3]\nReferences\n^ a b Historic Environment Scotland. \"Auchen Castle (SM683)\".

    "text": "Dervorguilla of Galloway by Wilhelm Sonmans\nRuins of Buittle Castle\nBuittle Castle, also known historically as Botle or Botel Castle, is a Motte and Bailey site in Galloway, south-west Scotland with significant early and medieval history comprising a significant ruined Norman style Motte, and several extant buildings and gardens, including the later residential building in the form of the Tower House, on the historic Bailey. It is located in the valley of the River Urr, 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) west of Dalbeattie. The castle is within the parish of Buittle, in the traditional county of Kirkcudbrightshire and is a scheduled ancient monument.[1][2]\nA motte and bailey castle was built either by Uchtred, Lord of Galloway or his son Roland, Lord of Galloway, in the 12th century. The castle passed by marriage to John de Balliol through the heiress of Alan, Lord of Galloway, Dervorguilla of Galloway, who built the Norman castle. Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, captured the castle in 1286. The castle was in English hands in 1296. King Robert the Bruce captured the castle in 1308,[3] and it was given to Sir James Douglas, Lord of Douglas.\nThe castle came into Edward Balliol's hands in 1332, before being given to Archibald the Grim, 3rd Earl of Douglas, in 1372. The castle remained in the hands of the Douglasses until 1456, when the castle reverted to the Crown. The castle was later in the hands of the Maxwells and briefly the Gordons of Lochinvar. The Motte was slighted in 1595, leaving the remaining buildings of the Bailey, which, it is believed, had already been taken on by this time as the primary residential buildings.[4] This residential shift from the motte to the bailey of the castle began, in the first place, with the building of a Mansion House dated to AD 1347,[5] likely affixed to the keep of the bailey, built by Edward Balliol, and latterly by the Tower House as the primary residential building of the castle. By this time in Scottish history, the tower house was the prevailing form of castle, or fortified building in Scotland.[6]\nThe castle was in the ownership of the Maxwells of Buittle by the 16th century,[7] but by the mid 18th century, probably due to a combination of Jacobite associations and changing fashion, the family had moved to Munches House, a Neo-Classical mansion a few miles to the west. It was at this time that the historic Motte and Bailey were put to agricultural use, and subsumed into the larger Munches Estate. Francis Grosse shows the Castle in a roofless state in 1798, with agricultural activities being undertaken in the buildings of the courtyard.[8] The Munches Estate was divided and sold in the mid 20th century, but the ruins of the Motte were separately disponed from the bailey and remained in the possession of the Maxwells of Munches until 1984 when they were gifted to Balliol College, Oxford by Peter Maxwell QC of Munches [1] himself a Balliol man. [2]\nEarly history\nBetween 1993 and 2000 significant archeological excavations were undertaken on the bailey of Buittle Castle, by A. Penman and E Cochrane. From these it has become apparent that the site has been occupied since at least the Mesolithic age, and also was subsequently occupied and, presumably, fortified by the Romans at this strategic point of crossing over the Water of Urr.\nAmongst the finds were a proliferation of Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age artefacts. The digs uncovered evidence of a permanent settlement during the Mesolithic era, temporary settlement during the Neolithic/Early Bronze Age, and permanent Iron Age/Romano-British occupation from the time of Agricola's invasion of Galloway in AD 82–84. An area of prehistoric pasture land has yielded a number of lithics, and there is post-hole and pottery evidence of an early roundhouse on this level.\nNumerous prehistoric lithics and a small quantity of Roman and Romano-British pottery including sherds of amphora, a Romano-Celtic shrine, Romano-British pottery and a Roman bronze cavalry stud were also found.[9]\nMedieval period\nIt appears that sometime around the turn of the 11th century the raised areas of ground were moated and a timber Motte and Bailey fortress was established.[10] This complemented the existing Motte of Urr, further up the river. With the construction of this timber fortification and the large complex of buildings which sprung up around it, we see the proper beginnings of the Castle, which was to later be fortified in stone.[11]\nThe stone fortifications ca. 1200 eventually comprised the residential Motte (some 100 x 150 feet), where the Lords of Galloway had their private chambers as well as the major reception rooms necessary for the running of a semi-sovereign demesne, the Inner Bailey with its two-storey Keep, Chapel of Ease, and associated buildings, and the Outer Bailey, likely comprising workshops and servants dwellings, stabling, etc.[12] These eventually formed the primary seat of the Lords of Galloway, which Lordhip was eventually settled on Devorguilla, as the sole surviving heiress of Alan of Galloway.\nIt is difficult to understate Lady Devorguilla's influence during her lifetime, especially in her Lordship of Galloway which centred around her seat at Buittle. Her marriage to John de Balliol of Barnard Castle was a powerful alliance which only increased her status. In her own right she owned manors from France to Hitchin in Hertfordshire, and the coming together of the two great houses of Galloway and Balliol meant that the pair wielded an enormous amount of power. By all accounts, however, Devorguilla was noted for her piety and she and her husband ruled Galloway benevolently and with an eye to the public good.[13] It was likely under her auspices that the Chapel of Ease, now no longer extant, was built at Buittle, and it must be either this establishment or her promulgation of the Statutes of Balliol College, annotated 'apud Botel', which is connected to the discovery of a Papal Bulla of Honorius IV during the excavations on the bailey.[14]\nAlthough King John did try to rule in the example of his parents, his attempts to summon parliaments, and to put down lawlessness were not enough to stave off accusations of ceding too much power to King Edward of England, to whom he was greatly indebted for support during the Great Cause. When he was forced to rebel against English control of Scotland, his followers were roundly defeated by the English at the Battle of Dunbar (1296) after which he was stripped of the crown of Scotland by Edward I and became a prisoner of the English, never returning to Buittle Castle. The castle eventually fell to Robert the Bruce's forces in February 1313, under the command of his brother Edward Bruce. King Robert retained possession of Buittle until finally granting it to Sir James Douglas, Lord of Douglas. The Douglases retained possession until Edward Balliol, King John's son, was crowned in 1332 in his attempt to overthrow King Robert the Bruce's son, King David II, but his attempt failed miserably.[15] The new Lord of Douglas, Sir William, later Earl of Douglas, recaptured Buittle Castle for King David in 1352 and it once more reverted to the Douglases.[16]\nEdward built a stone and timber-framed Mansion House on the Bailey in preference to the Motte. It is likely at this time that the fortified, or Barmkin, Courtyard would have been established which is today attached to the Tower House, thereby making a more easily defended central nucleus of buildings. If Edward's father could have been said to be a failed King of Scots, he was nothing compared to Edward himself, who ceded the whole of Lothian to Edward III, King of England in thanks for his support in retaking the throne. In 1356, after a series of astonishing setbacks, he surrendered his claim to the Scottish Throne, and died in Doncaster a year later.[17][18]\nIn 1456 Buittle reverted to the Crown, as part of the James, 9th Earl of Douglas's forfeiture. It would seem that, at this time, James III of Scotland settled the Barony of Buittle on his Queen, Margaret of Denmark, as part of her dowry. Some time after, it was granted to the Maxwells, in whose hands it remained for the next 450 years.[19]\nGeorgian to 20th century - farming period\nWilliam, 15th Lord Maxwell, who, after his father's death, was affectionately called the 6th Earl of Nithsdale by the people of Galloway, participated in the Jacobite Rising of 1745, but, apart from suffering the indignities imposed on all Jacobite supporters, seems to have come away from the affair relatively unscathed. Like all Jacobites, he was no longer legally permitted to make repairs to fortified buildings. It is likely that, at this time, he closed the tower of Buittle Castle and unroofed it for tax purposes, putting the courtyard's other buildings to agricultural use. Munches House, a new mansion in the Neo-Classical Robert Adam style, became the seat of the Maxwells of Munches, Terraughty, and Buittle, a subsidiary line of the Lord's of Maxwell. Buittle, therefore, passed through this Maxwell line, but, with the more fashionable house at Munches as the seat of the consolidated estate. It was not until ca. 1820 that Buittle was re-roofed and inhabited by tenant farmers. The most famous of these late 18th-century Maxwells was John Maxwell of Terraughty, born at Buittle, and presumably the last resident of the castle before the move to Munches. He was immortalised in Robert Burns's birthday epistle to him, which begins:\n‘Health to the Maxwell's veteran Chief!\nHealth, aye unsour'd by care or grief:\nInspired I turn'd Fate's sibyl leaf\nThis natal morn;\nI see thy life is stuff o’ prief,\nScarce quite half-worn.’\nIn 1949 Desmond Herries-Maxwell disponed the lands of Buittle to smallholding dairy farmers the Barrowmans. Desmond Maxwell, and latterly his son Peter Maxwell, Lord Maxwell QC however, retained portions of the estate. In 1984 Lord Maxwell bequeathed the ruins of the ancient Motte unto ‘The Master and Scholars of Balliol College’. This historic conveyance marked the 720th anniversary of the founding of Balliol.\nRestoration and present day\nOld Place of Buittle\nThe current buildings, known during the farming period as Old Place of Buittle or Buittle Place [20] comprise the Barmkin Courtyard with its main building - a largely 16th century Tower House, as well as a printing workshop and other outbuildings in the grounds of the bailey. It would seem that the tower house with courtyard complex had become known as Buittle Castle at least until the buildings were given over to agricultural use in the 18th century, as witnessed by Grose, Cardonnel, MacGibbon and Ross, et al.[21][22][23] By about 1790 the tower was roofless but in the mid-nineteenth century it was re-roofed to serve as accommodation for farm workers when it became part of the neighbouring Munches estate, during which time the bartizan angle turrets were removed.[24] The buildings, therefore, provided a challenge for restoration as significant farm buildings and arrangements had been erected during this period, as well as significant historical features removed.\nThe site was sold in 1992 to Jeffrey Burn, an artist, historian and re-enactor, who started the restoration of the historic buildings, largely stripping away the alterations and accretions of the farming period.[25] Burn renamed the buildings 'Old Buittle Tower', seemingly the first time that this name was used in connection to the property. The current owners have reverted to the name used by Grose and Cardonnel of Buittle Castle, reflecting the continued occupation and history of the comprehensive site. This courtyard of the current castle contains the Talla-bìdh Tea Room, the Laigh or Great Hall, and B&B accommodation. In the vaulted undercroft of the tower is a chapel which regularly offers liturgical services according to the medieval Use of Sarum under the auspices of the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of North and South America and the British Isles. The grounds contain a variety of garden areas designed and installed to highlight periods in the site's history, including a sunken garden designed on 15th century models by Anne Jennings. The property comprising the bailey of Buittle Castle is now used as a private residence, B&B, and religious site. The ruinous Motte of the Motte and Bailey site remains in the possession of Balliol College, Oxford, and is positioned to the immediate east of the Bailey.\nCitations\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Buittle Place.\nhttp://archives.balliol.ox.ac.uk/History/buittle.asp\nOfficial website\n54°56′07″N 3°50′40″W / 54.9352°N 3.8445°W / 54.9352; -3.8445\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerlaverock_Castle",
    "text": "Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland\nCaerlaverock Castle is a moated triangular castle first built in the 13th century. It is located on the southern coast of Scotland, eleven kilometres (seven miles) south of Dumfries, on the edge of the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve. Caerlaverock was a stronghold of the Maxwell family from the 13th century until the 17th century, when the castle was abandoned. It was besieged by the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, and underwent several partial demolitions and reconstructions over the 14th and 15th centuries. In the 17th century, the Maxwells were created Earls of Nithsdale, and built a new lodging within the walls, described as among \"the most ambitious early classical domestic architecture in Scotland\".[1] In 1640 the castle was besieged for the last time by the Protestant Covenanter army and was subsequently abandoned. Although demolished and rebuilt several times, the castle retains the distinctive triangular plan first laid out in the 13th century. Caerlaverock Castle was built to control trade in early times.[2]\nThe castle, which is protected as a scheduled monument, is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland,[3] and is a popular tourist attraction.\nEtymology\nThe name Caerlaverock is of Brittonic origin.[4] The first part of the name is the element cajr meaning \"an enclosed, defensible site\", (Welsh caer meaning \"fort, city\").[4] The second part of the name may be the personal name Lïμarch (Welsh Llywarch),[4] or a lost stream-name formed from the adjective laβar, \"talkative\" (Welsh llafar, see Afon Llafar),[4] suffixed with –ǭg, \"having the quality of\",[4] or the adjectival suffix -īg.[4] The present form has been influenced by the Scots word laverock, \"skylark\".[4]\nHistory\nView of one of the northern towers of the old, early 13th-century castle\nThe present castle was preceded by several fortifications in the area: a Roman fort on Ward Law Hill and a British hill fort that was in use around 950. The chronicles in the 12th-century Annales Cambriæ state that King Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio died nearby at the Battle of Arthuret in 573. His death triggered his bard Myrddin Wyllt to go insane and retreat into the woods, an act that later inspired the character of Merlin in Arthurian legend.[5]\nThe Maxwell family can be traced back to Undwin and his son Maccus in the 11th century; Maccus gave his name to the barony of Maccuswell or Maxwell. His grandson, John de Maccuswell (d. 1241), was first Lord Maxwell of Caerlaverock. The Baronies of Maxwell and Caerlaverock then passed down through the male line, sometimes collaterally. Robert de Maxwell of Maxwell, Caerlaverock and Mearns (d. 1409) rebuilt Caerlaverock castle and was succeeded by Herbert Maxwell of Caerlaverock (d. 1420).\nThe earliest mention of the lands of Caerlaverock is around 1160, when they were granted to the monks of Holm Cultram Abbey.[1] Around 1220 Alexander II of Scotland granted the lands to Sir John Maxwell, making him Warden of the West March. Sir John Maxwell also served as Chamberlain of Scotland from 1231 to 1233,[1] and began work on the first castle at Caerlaverock. This castle was square in shape and was one of the earliest stone castles to be built in Scotland. It had a moat with a bridge facing north. Only the foundations and remains of a wooden enclosure around it remain.[6]\nThis early castle may have been incomplete when it was abandoned in favour of a rock outcrop some 200 metres (660 ft) to the north. It was here that Sir John's brother Sir Aymer Maxwell began construction of the present castle. Sir Aymer also served as Chamberlain in 1258–1260, and was Justiciar of Galloway in 1264.[1] In the 1270s the \"new\" castle was completed, and Herbert Maxwell, nephew of John Maxwell, occupied it.\nHistoric view of Caerlaverock Castle\nWhen the moat around the second castle was dug, the quarrying was probably a source of building stone for the castle.[7] While the gatehouse stands on natural rock, the rest of the castle was built on a clay platform created especially for the castle.[8]\nWars of independence\nIn 1299, the garrison of Caerlaverock attacked Lochmaben Castle which was held by English forces.\nSiege of Caerlaverock\nCaerlaverock Castle by J. M. W. Turner, c.1832\nThe castle from the south-west in 2016\nIn July 1300 King Edward I of England marched north with an army including eighty-seven of the Barons of England and several knights of Brittany and Lorraine, and besieged Caerlaverock. Those present on the English side included Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln; Robert FitzWalter; Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford; John, Baron Segrave; Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick; John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond; Patrick, Earl of March and his son; Prince Edward (the future Edward II); Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and his brother Henry; Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel; and Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham. The Maxwells, under their chief Sir Eustace Maxwell, mounted a vigorous defence of the castle which repelled the English several times. In the end, the garrison was compelled to surrender, after which it was found that only sixty men had withstood the whole English army for a considerable period.\nDuring the siege the English heralds composed a roll of arms in Old French verse, known as the Siege of Caerlaverock, in which each noble or knight present was named, his feats of valour described, and a poetic blazon of his armorial bearings given.[9][10][11][12]\nRecovery\nPossession of the castle was subsequently restored to Sir Eustace Maxwell, Sir Herbert's son, who at first embraced the cause of John Balliol, and in 1312 received from Edward II an allowance of £20 for the more secure keeping of the castle. He afterwards gave in his adherence to Robert Bruce, and his castle, in consequence, underwent a second siege by the English, in which they were unsuccessful. Fearing that this important stronghold might ultimately fall into the hands of the enemy, and enable them to make good their hold on the district, Sir Eustace dismantled the fortress, service and sacrifice for which he was liberally rewarded by Robert Bruce.\nBy 1337 the castle was once again inhabited, and Sir Eustace now changed sides again, giving his support to Edward Balliol. Around 1355 Sir Roger Kirkpatrick of Closeburn captured Caerlaverock for David II of Scotland, and partly dismantled the castle.[13]\nRepair and rebuilding\nView showing the latter addition to the castle at the north end of the Inner Court\nBy the end of the Wars of Independence in the mid-14th century, Caerlaverock had been regained by the Maxwells, with Sir Robert Maxwell rebuilding much of the castle between 1373 and 1410.[13] Further work was undertaken by Robert, 2nd Lord Maxwell, in the mid-15th century, probably involving reconstruction of the gatehouse. A new west range was added within the walls around 1500.[13]\nThe Catholic Maxwells took up the cause of Mary, Queen of Scots, after her forced abdication in 1567. Caerlaverock was besieged in 1570 by an English Protestant force led by the Earl of Sussex, and was again partly demolished, including the destruction of the gatehouse with gunpowder.[13]\nBy 1593, John, 8th Lord Maxwell was repairing the castle again, building up the gatehouse for defence against the Johnstones of Annandale, with whom the Maxwells were feuding.[13] The 8th Lord was killed by the Johnstones during a fight at Dryfe Sands, and in 1613 the 9th Lord Maxwell was executed for the revenge murder of Sir James Johnstone.\nEarls of Nithsdale\nIn 1619 Robert, 10th Lord Maxwell, married Elizabeth Beaumont, cousin of the Duke of Buckingham, a favourite of James VI of Scotland. He was subsequently made Earl of Nithsdale and appointed to the Privy Council of Scotland. To reflect his new status he built the elaborate south and east ranges within the castle, known as the Nithsdale Lodging.[13]\nCaerlaverock Castle in 1900\nThe new ranges were completed around 1634. Nithsdale was at Caerlaverock in August 1637, and wrote to Sir Richard Graham asking for dogs for hunting and breeding.[14] Religious turmoil soon turned against the staunchly Catholic Maxwells. In 1640 the Protestant Covenanter army besieged Caerlaverock for 13 weeks, eventually forcing its surrender. According to Sir Henry Vane, the Earl and Countess of Nithsdale and their page were allowed to leave, but 40 defenders called Maxwell were put to the sword.[15] The south wall and tower were demolished, and the castle was never repaired or reoccupied.[13]\nIn the mid 19th century, the castle was in the possession of William Constable-Maxwell, 10th Lord Herries of Terregles (1804–1876), heir of the 5th Earl of Nithsdale.[16]\nArchitectural description\nThe castle ground floor plan from MacGibbon and Ross, showing the ranges of the building.\nThe castle is most unusual in having a triangular form, one of only a small number across Europe and the only one in the UK. [17] As well, it is unusual for Scotland in having a moat and earthwork ramparts around it. It sits in a low lying formerly swampy area on the flood plain of the nearby River Nith, again unusual for a defensive structure in this area of Scotland. It is however, the finest example of a castle in south-west Scotland. [18]\nThe basic form is triangular, with the Gatehouse to the north formed of two large drum towers (see plan). In the south west and south east corners there are further but smaller drum towers. Murdoch’s Tower to the south west is largely complete, but the tower to the south east was reduced to base level during the Covenanter siege of 1640.\nDespite many sieges and slightings followed by rebuildings, the original form of the castle can still be appreciated, the curtain wall bases largely remaining at lower levels, these dating to the original construction in the last quarter of the thirteenth century (HES Statement of Significance op cit, p10) The early parts of the castle were built of red sandstone quarried at nearly Bankend. [19] While of later build, to the west and east much of the curtain walls stand to parapet height.\nWithin the courtyard formed by the curtain walls there are four ranges: the Gatehouse, the west range, the Banqueting Hall range and the Nithsdale Lodging range (see plan), a small triangular courtyard being formed between them. [20] These ranges are of different dates. Especially to the south, the buildings are ruinous, the Banqueting Hall range in particular being reduced for the most part to no more than a few metres high.\nA. The Gatehouse range is the earliest remaining part of the castle. It consists of the two massive drum towers faced in ashlar with the entrance passage between the towers. The west tower is largely original, but the east tower was largely rebuilt in the late fifteenth century. While ruinous at the upper levels, the drum towers still stand above the drawbridge to a height of some 15.5 metres to the machicolations, these dating to the late fifteenth century rebuild. Internally, the gatehouse has an entrance with portcullis and above a hall, later subdivided (Stell op cit, p112).\nB. The west range dates to around 1500 and while roofless is largely complete. The range consists essentially of a series of rectangular rooms on two floors, each with a fireplace, the rooms most likely used as accommodation (Stell op cit, p112.)\nC. The south or Banqueting House range was reduced to walls of only a few metres high or less, largely as a result of the Covenanter's siege in 1640, when artillery fire and then slighting reduced the walls (and at the same time the SE tower). The Hall was of substantial size, and some evidence of its former grandeur can be gauged from the remains of the large fireplace on the north wall.\nD. Sitting to the north east of the interior, and the last part of the castle to be built, the Nithsdale Lodging building is the most complete part of the castle. Although lacking its two eastern most bays it is perhaps the most spectacular part of the castle, with its magnificent Renaissance façade of the 1630s (SoS op cit, 12-13). The remaining front is decorated with a series of carved pediments over nine large windows, three smaller ones and two doorways, depicting various armorials and symbolic sculptures (SoS op cit, 16-18) . Internally, the rooms are quite small, due to the placement of a fireplace/flue block in the centre of the structure. With the kitchens and other service rooms on the ground floor, the rooms on the first and higher floors were most likely used as private apartments.\nNature reserve\nCaerlaverock Castle is within the Nith Estuary National Scenic Area, protected for its scenic qualities, with the castle recognised as a landmark of the area.[21] The castle is at the northern edge of the Caerlaverock National Nature Reserve, which extends to 55 square kilometres (21 sq mi) and consists of saltmarsh, mudflats and grazing land. It is an internationally important wintering site for waterfowl and wading birds, including the barnacle goose.[22]\nCultural references\nThe castle was used as a location for the 2011 romantic comedy film The Decoy Bride.[23]\nReferences\nBibliography\nBrault, Gerard J., ed.

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruggleton_Castle",
    "text": "Castle in Scotland\nCruggleton Castle is a multi-period archaeological site on the coast of the Machars, in the historical county of Wigtownshire in south-west Scotland. It is located at Cruggleton Point, around 4.5 kilometres (2.8 mi) east of Whithorn and 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) south-east of Sorbie. Excavations in the 1970s and 1980s revealed several periods of use, from the 1st century AD to the 17th century. The first stone tower was built in the 13th century, on an earlier motte.\nThe castle is located on a high outcrop of shale, which forms a promontory on the east-facing cliff edge, about 40 metres (130 ft) above sea level. The name \"Cruggleton\" is taken to derive from the rocky nature of the site.[1]\nHistory of the site\nExcavations on the site revealed the remains of a late Iron Age hut circle, and of a timber hall dated to the early medieval period. During the 12th or 13th century, the rock outcrop was raised to form a motte and a timber tower was built. During this time, Cruggleton Castle was possibly a seat of the Lords of Galloway, passing to the Earls of Buchan. The earliest stone tower and curtain wall was built between the late 13th and early 15th centuries.[2] In the 1290s, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, had a licence from Edward I to dig for lead in the Calf of Man, to cover eight towers of the castle.[3] Cruggleton, also known as \"The Black Rock of Cree\", has been associated with the stronghold on the Water of Cree that William Wallace captured, with his companions Stephen of Ireland and Kerlé, according to Blind Harry.[4] It was again taken by Scottish forces in 1307 and subsequently demolished. Later in the 14th century, King David II granted Cruggleton to Gilbert Kennedy. In 1424 it was granted to the Prior and Canons of Whithorn.[5]\nIn 1563 the spies of Queen Elizabeth I of England visited south-west Scotland to examine the defences at Cruggleton, Wigtown, Cardoness and Kirkcudbright. They noted that Cruggleton \"is now kept but with 2 men only but when the Prior of Whithorn lies there then under 20 men without artillery.\" They also made a coloured drawing of the castle, now held by the British Museum, that shows a high tower, surrounded by a curtain wall with sloped merlons and defended by drawbridge and portcullis.[5]\nAfter the Reformation, church lands were distributed among the nobles of Scotland. A dispute arose over Cruggleton Castle between Lord Robert Stewart, Commendator of Whithorn Priory, and John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming, which was heard by the civil courts. Despite this in 1569 Stewart, an illegitimate son of James V, was besieged in the castle by Lord Fleming. James Stewart, Earl of Moray, also an illegitimate son of James V, interceded on his brother's behalf by writing to Sir Patrick Vaus of Barnbarroch, urging him to relieve the siege. The dispute was resolved in favour of Margaret Stewart, Mistress of Ochiltree, in the 1580s.[6]\nCruggleton was later held by Sir Patrick Vaus, who died in 1598. It passed to his son Sir John Vaus who disposed of the property to Peter McDowall of Machermore, who in turn sold it to James Kennedy in 1606. The castle passed through various owners during the following decades, but by 1684 it was described as \"wholly demolished and ruinous.\"[7]\nCruggleton ruins\nCruggleton Castle is accessible along a coastal path from the grounds of nearby Galloway House. Today the outward remains consist of a narrow section of barrel vaulting in what was the tower. It is known locally as 'The Arch' and is clearly visible from the B7063 Garlieston to Isle of Whithorn road. Formerly supported on metal bands, the stonework has recently been rebuilt (how recently?) and stands around 3 metres (9.8 ft) high. The foundations of several further buildings can be seen across the site. The outline of the motte is still clearly visible, measuring around 31 by 29 metres (102 by 95 ft), as is a broad ditch across the promontory, about 50 metres (160 ft) west of the ruins.[7][8] The remains are a scheduled monument.[9]\nCruggleton Church\nCruggleton Church is about 750 metres (2,460 ft) west of the castle and may indicate the approximate site of the village of Cruggleton. It was established in the early 12th century by Fergus, Lord of Galloway, and remains the most complete Romanesque church in the area.

It was sited by the River Nith, in the area now known as Castledykes Park.[1]\nA motte and bailey castle was built in the 12th century. The town was created a royal burgh by King William the Lion in 1186. The castle was enlarged and rebuilt in stone in 1214. King Alexander III of Scotland visited the castle in 1264 to plan an expedition against the Isle of Man. Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale captured the castle in 1286. The castle was occupied by the English from 1298. King Edward I of England stayed at the castle in 1300. Robert de Brus captured the castle briefly in 1306 from the English-appointed constable Richard Siward. King Robert I of Scotland captured the castle on 7 February 1313 from the English appointed constable, his enemy Dungal Macdouall, who had turned King Robert's brothers, Thomas and Alexander, over to Edward I, who promptly executed them. According to the RCAHMS there is \"a strong belief\" that it was destroyed after the capture and never rebuilt.[1]\nSee also\nTroqueer Castle\nKirkhill Castle\nCitations\n55°03′22″N 3°36′08″W / 55.0561°N 3.6022°W / 55.0561; -3.6022\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Dunskey Castle is a ruined, 12th-century tower house or castle, located 0.5 miles (0.80 km) south of the village of Portpatrick, Rhinns, Wigtownshire, on the south-west coast of Scotland.[1]\nDunskey Castle is a scheduled monument,[2] a 'nationally important' archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change.\nDunskey Castle\nDescription\nThe three-storey L-plan structure is sited on a promontory, with a rock-cut ditch, 15 metres (49 ft) wide by 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) deep, defending the only access, from the north-east.[3] The castle measures 30 by 14.3 metres (98 by 47 ft), with walls 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) thick, although the building is now a roofless shell. The north-east wing is of a later date, and the foundations of a south range are visible. Near the castle are the remains of a watchtower, 7 metres (23 ft) square, built on the cliff edge.[4] Timothy Pont's map drawn c. 1580 – 1590 shows Dunskay Castle with 2 watchtowers on the cliff edge fronting the sea.[5] Francis Grose's drawing dated show of 10 May 1790s the ruins of the foundations and sea-wall on the south, and what looks to be the large entrance door in the southern corner from where the inside staircase may have led straight up to the new \"Hall\" built c.1520. Grose's drawing shows Ireland (approx. Island Magee / Larne area) in the background across the sea.[6]\nIn virtue of a tradition preserved in the Book of Leinster, W. J. Watson identifies the place named in it as Port Rig (Portrie, Portree) with the later Portpatrick, connecting 'Rig' with Reregonium, which he regards as the royal town of the Novantae and places in this region. He would thus carry Portpatrick's history back to the first century of our era, while he dates a rather later reference to about AD 250.[7] Portpatrick was known as the port of Castle Dunskey.\nDunskey is undoubtedly romantic. It was a location for the 1951 film Kidnapped of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Double X: The Name of the Game (1992), as well as for the 1952 film Hunted.\nThe owner, Lady Amy McFall, restricts public access to the castle.\n13th and 14th centuries\nIn the 1290s, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, had a licence from Edward I of England, reigned 1272–1307) to dig for lead in the Calf of Man (off the coast of the Isle of Man), to cover eight towers of the Cruggleton Castle / Crogiltoun Castle in Wigtownshire. Was Dunskey Castle built about this time ?[8] and in 1291 the nearby Wigtown Castle was in the hands of the same Edward I who committed it to the charge of Walter de Currie or Cory / Corry / Coree (laird of Dunskey). King Edward I ultimately conferred Wigtown Castle (and Dunskey Castle ?) on John Balliol the Scottish King (reigned 1292-1296 after which Scotland was without a monarch for 10 years and Sir William Wallace fought the English in 1297, but was defeated at Falkirk in 1298).[9]\nBy 10 October 1303 Walter de Corry was dead and his lands were taken into the King's hands (King Edward I of England).[10][11][12][13]\nOn 28 August 1296 the Ragman Rolls for Wigtownshire had been compiled at Berwick-on-Tweed, which time and place King Edward I of England also convened a Parliament of those\nScottish nobles summoned by him to attend at the border city. The Wigtownshire roll contained 26 names, and some who were later associated with Dunskey Castle were Thomas de KITHEHILT (Adair of Kinhilt / Kilhelt); Fergus MakDowylt (MacDowell); Thomas MacUlagh (MacCullough / McCullagh); Andrew (McDowell) de Logan; Dougal MacDowly (MacDowell / McDowell); Gilbert de Hanneth (Hannay); William MacUlagh (MacCullough / McCullagh); Michel MacUlagh (MacCullough); Johan Seneschal (Stewart, from whom descended the Earls of Darnly and Lennox); Maria, Queen of Mann and the Isles.[14]\nc. 1326 \"Index of Charters, &c. by King Robert I.\" King Robert I Robert the Bruce (born 1274 reigned 1306-1329 after the Interregnum 1296-1306). p. 27 \"In the Roll of Robert the First, marked on the back with this mark, X. 1.

II index on p. 1134 BALLIVUS de Carrick, lists p. 94 no.414, 13 February 1450 Gilbert Kennedy of Dunure \"REX confirmavit Gilberto Kenedy de Dunure consang. suo, – quod ipse Gilbertus et heredes sui masculi essent caput totius progeniei sue tam in calumpniis quam in aliis articulis et negotiis ad KENKYNOLL pertinere valentibus; unaetum officio ballivi comitatus de Carric et hominum ipsius dectione et cum armorum ostensione in omnibus, sub comite de Carric qui pro tempore fuerit; – que idem Gilb. personaliter resignavit.\" iv. 182.[20] – was he a bailie & Kenkynol, as Exchequer Roll 1455 shows Gilberti Kenedy, BALLIVI comitatus de carric had ward of Kylnnahelt (Dunskey).[21]\nGilbert Kennedy of Dunure, bailie of Carrick, did not enjoy Dunskey Castle for long as in 1455, Exchequer Rolls of Scotland records that he was compensated for NOT having the ward of Adair.[22] If he was the same Gilbert, he married Christian Adair and her son, apparently Rolland Adair, must have come of age about 1456. Christian Adair Kennedy was a widow and Dunskey apparently was resigned by Gilbert Kennedy then shown as of Quhiltis which may have been \"White Hills\" next to/or Kilhilt / Kinhilt, to William Earl of Douglas[23] who in turn must have assigned it over to Rolland Adair when he came of age.\nIn 1457 the Exchequer Rolls, Vigtoun (Wigtownshire) listed \"Libri Responsionum\" notes that Rolandi Adair t. Gilhelt (Kilhelt) had sasine of Crecach, Dunnone, Pennyanach, Kildonan (Dunskey, o'wise Portree see p. 688), Carny, and Lochbeg (Laughbeg or Middle Laigh).[24] Carny is shown on Pont's map as \"Karn Multibrugh\" north of Lefnol (Leffnoll / Lesnoll / Lochnoll) and as \"Cairn\" on Ainslie's 1782 map of the County of Wigton, in the National Library of Scotland, digital library early maps[25]\nIn 1486 ADAIR (Adare), Rolland, deceased, father of William Adair (who must have been under-age) the ward of his lands of Kilhelt, Portre (Dunskey), Kildonane and Drummore, had been granted to an Alexander Bruce c.1468 who had had them in error for 18 years. p. 381 error of accounting for 18 years.[26]\nIn 1488 William Adair of Dunskey Castle & Kinhilt and McCulloch of nearby Ardwell, Stoneykirk, were attacked by sheriff Quentin Agnew of Lochnaw Castle and his band of men. Agnew was pursued before the Lords of Council and in 1489 Agnew had to pay for the goods taken, but was entitled to a rebate if he returned them in good order.[27]\nAbout 1489 Dunskey / Dunsky Tower House [ otherwise Castle ] was partially burnt by Sir Alexander (Sandy) M'Culloch of Myrtoun Clan McCulloch.[28] – 3 March 1499, pardon for McCulloch, along with respites for burning the Place of Dunskay granted to Duncane Makke, litil Gilbert Makke, Johne Clerk Makee & Andro Akersane.\nIn the early 1500s Dunskey Castle was repaired by the Adairs of Kinhilt (the Hall of Dunskey was rebuilt and was 36feet by 17feet).[29] The Adairs built the Castle of St. John in nearby Stranraer Wigtownshire about 1510.[30]Dunskey Castle by Francis Grose 1790[31]29 August 1496 \"Anent the complaynt made be Wilzeam Adaire of Kilhelt and Archibald Makculloch of Ardwell apoun Schir Alexander McCulloch of Mertoune, knicht Clan McCulloch, Owchtre McDowell of Gerthloy (Uchtred McDowell of Garthland) Clan Macdowall, and thare complicis, that quhair thai war dylatit of art and part of the slauchter of umquhile DYONYSE of Hammyltoun, quilkis was slane on Mydsummer evin that last was, in the toune of Wigtoun, thai bean innocent thareof, and was redy al tymes to underly our soverane Lordis lawis tharefore as was allegiit, quharefore the persons forsaid with thare complicis assegit the place of DUNSKAY pertenyng to the sade Wilzeam Adair and rasit fyre and byrnt the sammyn and skaithit the said Wilzeam in househald geire tharethrou, extending to the soume of xl li., throw the quhilk fyre rasing thai birnt ane box pertenyng to Elyse McCulloch quhilk thai had in keping and in it j li. and the skaith of the birnyng of the sade Wilzeam house extending to xx li., and als that thai tuke and spulzeit fra the sade Wilzeam foure horses with a part of barkit hydis, as was rychtsa allegiit, and als fra the sade Archbald McCulloch and his pure folkis insicht gudis of househald to the availe of xxx li., togidder with ix of ky and oxin, xviij of schepe, xvj horses and meris, tane be the sade Schir Alexander and his complicis as was inlikewise allegiit.\"[32]\nAfter September 1513 Ninian Adair of Kinhilt, as son and heir of William Adair who was killed at Flodden with McDowell, had Sasine (delivery of feudal property) of the estate.[33] Four years later Ninian had a renewal of the tack which had been granted to his father in 1512. It is said that Ninian Adair rebuilt the castle of Dunskey on a more magnificent scale than ever, and to put an end to the feud with the MacDowells he espoused Janet McDowell, a daughter of the house of Garthland Garthland Castle. The ground floor plan of Dunskey appears to show this new enlarged section (three cellars facing the land-side of Dunskey Castle with the \"new\" hall with a huge fireplace on the next floor).[34] The arched entrance appeared to be approximately at the south-eastern bottom corner room with circular steps leading up to the new hall. The archway to the entrance can be seen in Francis Grose's drawing, but only the top portion of the archway can now be seen. One peculiar aspect was that one of the new cellars or vaults appeared not to have had a door. Another aspect was \"...we went by water to see the ruins of an old castle (Dunskey), under this house, in the rock, is a cave, which, they say, goes a considerable distance under ground...\".[35] This cave may be shown in a photo of Dunskey Castle on Geograph.[36] There are other mentions of a piper \"ghost\" playing and pacing up and down perhaps in the cave.[37][38]\nIn 1520–1521 Ninian Adair had only a short time to enjoy his new additions to Dunskey Castle as in 1523 his son William was mentioned as his heir.[39] In 1520–1521 (as Ninian Adair's heir, William, was under-age) the warde his lands (including Dunskey castle) were put into the hands of the Gilbert Kennedy, 2nd Earl of Cassilis and Lord Maxwell.[40]\n17th century\nDunskey Castle from the north-east. photo by Anne Burgessc.1600 \"in Ninian Adair's time and his sons\" a browney \"hanted\" his house of Dunsky.[41][42]\nOn 5 April 1608 the lands of Guilielmus (William) Adair heir of Niniani Adair de Kinhilt, included 10 lib. terranium de Portrie cum castro de Dunskey in parochie de Inche Inch, Wigtownshire.[42][43] William Adair marriage contract 18 April 1580 to Rosina MacClellan of Galston whose brother, Sir Robert McClellan (McLellan) of MacLellan's Castle Kirkcudbright Clan MacLellan married 1614 Mary Montgomery, eldest daughter of Sir Hugh Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Ards, county Down, Ireland.[44]\nIn February 1620, \"10 librat of antiqui extentus de Portry\" including \"3 mercatas de Marok cum castro de Doneskey\" was acquired by Hugh Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery who extended the castle by building the \"Gallery\" leading off from the \"Hall\" and vaults under the \"Gallery\".[18]\nOn 24 August 1632 Sara Maxwell, Viscountess Montgomerie, wrote a letter to her husband, Hugh Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery (Montgomerie of Airds) \"It seameth ye ar causing your workmen goe on both in your building and theikine of your Gallerie att Dunskay.

    "text": "The 16th century Robgill Tower, since extended, perched on a hill overlooking the Kirtle Water\nRobgill Tower is a tower house near Kirkpatrick Fleming on the banks of the river Kirtle. It was one of a number of towers built along the border as protection against incursions by the English.[1]\nThe tower was owned for centuries by Clan Irvine, also spelled as Irving, but a report from 1834 indicates that it was owned by James Smail by that time. He had acquired it from Sir Emelius Irving.[2]\nEtymology\nThe name is from the Old English personal name Hreodbeorht (modern name Robert) and Old Norse gil \"ravine\". The name was recorded as Redbeilgill in 1125.\nHistory\nThe tower was probably built circa 1540 by the Irvine family who also owned Bonshaw Tower, but some documents indicate that it was built in 1430. Robgill Tower was the \"blue-print for Bonshaw Tower\" (3/4 of a mile distant) which was built in the same era.[3]\nThe Robgill tower was modified extensively in the 19th century. It has been B-listed since 1971. The Listing indicated that the structure - a medium scale mansion ... [with] crenellated retaining wall\" - was built in several phases primarily in the late 18th and early 19th century, although the nucleus was a 16th-century tower.[4]\nA subsequent report at the time indicated that there was a \"fine stable block dating from the later 19th C. and a sizeable walled garden with a large glasshouse. The stable block has gained a swimming pool and there is a large indoor equestrian arena\". The stable block is also Category-B listed[5][6] as are the Gate Lodge and Gate Peers. The Walled Garden is Category-C rated.[7]\nAn 1889 book about the architecture of Scotland states that about ten years earlier, the tower was modified: \"wilfully pulled down to the level of the hall floor\" to allow for a hall that would connect it to the new, adjoining, house that was being built.[8]\nA 1973 summary of the property indicated that the current owner was a Mr. Shaw.[9]\nA 2013 prospectus provided numerous diagrams, photographs and descriptions of each element of the property.[10] A 2019 summary stated that it had \"six reception rooms, an indoor swimming pool, a games room, gym, indoor riding arena, a six-car garage and a separate two-bedroom gate lodge\". The manor was restored recently and was said to have outstanding equestrian facilities\".[11][12]\nReferences\nRCHAMS\n55°2′1″N 3°10′39″W / 55.03361°N 3.17750°W / 55.03361; -3.17750\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle ruins in Scotland\nRuined tower of Sanquhar Castle Sanquhar Castle, now a ruin, was built in the 13th century; the ruins are situated north east of Dumfries overlooking the River Nith.[1] Situated on the southern approach to the former royal burgh of Sanquhar in Dumfries and Galloway, south west Scotland, it sits on the trail of the Southern Upland Way. The castle is a stronghold bounded on the west by the River Nith, to the north by a burn, and made strong by a deep ditch running the remainder of the boundary.\nHistory\nThe castle was built by the Ross family in the 13th century and then passed to the Crichton family in the 14th century.[2] In July 1617, James VI and I, visited the castle en route to Glasgow: the Crichtons welcomed him with a display so huge that it bankrupted them.[3] Sanquhar Castle was sold by the Crichtons in the mid 17th century to Sir William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry, who established the fairytale pink sandstone Drumlanrig Castle ten miles south of Sanquhar near Thornhill. From then on the castle at Sanquhar began to steadily crumble to a ruin, until 1895 when John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, purchased it and attempted to enthuse a restoration of his ancestral home, following successful restorations at Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch in Wales. This was undertaken by Robert Weir Schultz and the squarer and more structurally sound sections rebuilt at that time can clearly be identified.[4]\nWork ended following the death of the Marquess in 1900, and what is left of the site is a mix of restoration and original stonework, but still very far from any sense of completion. It is designated a scheduled monument.[5]\nReferences\nWorks cited\n\"Sanquhar Castle, Site Number NS70NE 3\". CANMORE. RCAHMS. Retrieved 19 August 2009.\nChisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). \"Sanquhar\" .

    "text": "Castle in Scotland\nTibbers Castle is a motte-and-bailey castle overlooking a ford across the River Nith in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. To the east is the village of Carronbridge and to the north west is a 16th-century country house, Drumlanrig Castle.[1]\nPossibly built in the 12th or 13th century, Tibbers was first documented in 1298 at which point the timber castle was replaced by a stone castle. It was the administrative centre of the barony of Tibbers until the second half of the 14th century when it shifted to nearby Morton. During the Anglo-Scottish Wars of the early 14th century the castle was captured by first the Scots under Robert the Bruce and then the English, before returning to Scottish control in 1313.\nThe castle descended through the Earls of Moray and subsequently the Earls of March before coming under the control of the Scottish Crown. A 'toun' was established near the castle. While it is unclear at what point Tibbers Castle fell out of use, by the 18th century the site was used for agriculture. Archaeological investigations took place in 1864, 1912, and 2013–2014.\nHistory\nEdward I of England visited Tibbers Castle in 1298.\nThe origin of Tibbers Castle is undocumented, and it may have been founded in the 12th or 13th century as a timber castle. It was first recorded in 1298 when Sir Richard Siward, either built the stone enclosure castle or enhanced one which had already been added to the timber structure.[2] King Edward I of England visited the castle the same year.[3] Siward was the Sheriff of Dumfries when the area was under the control of the English and documentation from this period gives some evidence for activity at the castle. In 1302, £100 was spent on the structured while it was manned by a 23-strong garrison.[1]\nThe death of Alexander III of Scotland in 1286 led to a succession crisis resulting in English rule of Scotland under Edward I. Robert the Bruce's family was one of the claimants and in 1306 he was crowned king, leading to war with England.[4] The first phase of Bruce's campaign in 1306 was to capture the English-held castles of Ayr, Dalswinton, Inverkip and Tibbers.[5] Control was given to John de Seton until the English recaptured the castle from the Scots,[6] hanging the defenders,[3] and a larger garrison, this time numbering 54, was installed. In 1313 the Scots regained control of the region. From there Tibbers Castle remained in Scottish hands, and was possessed by Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray. He was succeeded by Thomas Randolph, 2nd Earl of Moray and John Randolph, 3rd Earl of Moray. When John died at the battle of Neville's Cross in 1346 the earldom along with Tibbers Castle was given to Patrick, Earl of March. His son inherited in 1369 and acquired the barony of Morton which probably became the administrative centre for the barony of Tibbers. The estates descended through the Dunbar family until 1435 when their lands were confiscated by the Scottish Crown. In 1450 or 1451, King James II of Scotland subsequently gave Tibbers to George Crichton, Lord High Admiral of Scotland and later the 1st Earl of Caithness. When he died in 1454 the property again came under royal control.[6]\nA 'toun' or township at Tibbers was mentioned in 1451, and the presence of the castle did not prevent the town from being attacked by Sir Alexander Stewart of Garlies in 1547.[7] It is unclear when Tibbers Castle fell out of use, but in the 18th century, the ridge on which the castle sits was used to grow crops.[8] Part of the structure was demolished to reuse materials such as lime.[9] The \"Mote de Tibbris\" is mentioned in the Registrum Magni Sigilli in 1489 and 1541.[10]\nThe interpretation of Tibbers has changed over time, and in the 18th century it was thought to be a Roman fort though it was later understood to be a medieval castle.[11] The name of the castle led to the suggestion that it derived from Tiberius Caesar,[3] however 'Tibbers' comes from the Gaelic word 'Toibar' meaning a well.[1] The earliest recorded excavation at Tibbers Castle took place in 1864, which recovered two coins from the reign of Edward II of England (1307–1327) and a dagger from the early 15th century. The site was surveyed in 1912 with no further archaeological investigation until the 21st century.[12] It was designated as a scheduled ancient monument in 1937.[13] In 2013 and 2014 the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland carried out measured and geophysical (using resistivity and a gradiometer) surveys at Tibbers with funding from Historic Scotland and the Castle Studies Trust.[14]\nLayout\nOccupying a ridge on the west bank of the River Nith, the earliest phase of the castle consisted of a small bailey or enclosure. This bailey was revealed by the geophysical survey in 2014 which also indicated that it contained timber buildings.[15]\nWhen Richard Siward remodelled the castle c. 1298 it is likely that he added the motte with its stone enclosure castle and replaced the single small bailey with two large enclosures south of the motte. These enclosures may have housed a market as was the case at Lochmaben Castle.[16] There are few examples in Scotland of earthwork castles being rebuilt in stone. The four-sided motte measures 44 by 27 metres (144 by 89 ft) at the summit. The enclosure castle on top is roughly rectangular, measuring 26.8 by 11.6 metres (88 by 38 ft), with a round tower at each corner. Little survives above ground of this structure, though the south-south-east tower survives best. The south side of the enclosure castle had an additional tower which tower with the south-south-east corner tower flanked the entrance. Inside, the castle had a well on the east side and a range of buildings extending along the west and north sides; these likely contained a great hall, the kitchens, and a chamber.[17] There was a postern gate just south of the north-east tower.[18] This phase of Tibbers is \"one of the few authentic surviving remnants of English castle building in Scotland during the Plantagenet occupation.\"[19]\nAt its greatest extent Tibbers Castle measured 330 metres (1,080 ft) by 85 metres (279 ft). The courtyard of the enclosure castle is the inner bailey. The outer and outermost baileys each cover an area of about 0.4 hectares (0.99 acres). The ramparts enclosing the site survive to a height of 0.5 metres (1 ft 8 in) and are between 3.4 and 5.5 metres (11 and 18 ft) wide.[20] Double baileys are uncommon, with examples at Windsor and Llandinam.[21]\nSee also\nList of castles in Scotland\nMorton Castle\nReferences\nBibliography\nBarrow, G.

In 1544 the castle was attacked by Michael Lord Carlyle and sacked, in his raid against his sister-in-law, Jonet Scrimgeour. She was reinstated by Regent Arran - James Hamilton, Earl of Arran - and the legal settlement includes a list of the contents of the Castle in the Scots language, and the farmstock in Latin.[1] Michael Lord Carlyle retained the castle until the latter decades of the sixteenth century.\nDouglas family\nSee also: Clan Douglas\nIn 1609 the ownership of the castle passed from Michael Carlyle to his half brother Douglases of Parkhead since then became property of the Douglas family, the last resident of the castle was Archibald Douglas of Dornock whom lived there until 1630.\nRuins and restoration\nThe roof of the castle was removed in the eighteenth century, after it the Torthorwald castle drifted into ruin, during the next century efforts were made to stabilise its structure. In 1993 the north end of the tower collapsed.\nThe basement and first floor hall of this tower are vaulted and in one corner is a turnpike stair that leads to the upper floors.

    "text": "Dudhope Castle from the east\nDudhope Castle: ideal restoration\nArtist's impression of Dudhope Castle in the early 19th century.\nDudhope Castle is an extended late medieval tower house located on the southern face of Dundee Law in Dundee, Scotland.\nHistory\nConstruction and private ownership\nThe castle was originally built in the late 13th century by the Scrymgeour family, with the original castle being a smaller tower house.[1] This was replaced around 1460.\nJames V visited in April 1540.[2] The castle was further extended in 1580[3] for James Scrimgeour and Magdalen Livingstone to its current L-plan structure with additional circular \"angle\" towers, although these were demolished in the 18th century. Some dormer or storm windows had stone pediments dated \"1600\", with the initials \"DML\" for Dame Magdalen Livingstone.[4] James VI and I stayed at Dudhope on 20 May 1617.[5]\nOn the death in 1668 of John Scrimgeour, 13th [6] (or 14th)[7] Constable, and first Earl of Dundee, King Charles II ignored the existence of the rightful heir, John Scrimgeour of Kirkton, and made a grant of Dudhope Castle and the office of Constable to Charles Maitland, a younger brother of the 1st Duke of Lauderdale.\nLater, when in financial difficulty, Maitland sold Dudhope Castle in 1684 to John Graham of Claverhouse, better known to most as \"Bonnie Dundee\".[8] It was from Dudhope Castle that he departed for Killiecrankie in 1689; the victory which resulted in his death. In 1694, the King therefore made a grant of Dudhope Castle to Archibald Douglas. The Douglas family were thus the last family of occupants of the castle as this continued until about 1790.[6] The history of Dudhope and the Constables are therefore inextricably interwoven with the history of Dundee. In fact, the two are inseparable. The office of Constable and occupancy of Dudhope Castle was held by four different families, as above, of which the Scrymgeours held the post for some 370 years.[6][7][9]\nOther uses of the castle\nIn 1792 the castle was rented in an attempt to use it as a woollen factory, although the plan never came to fruition. In 1795 the park and the grounds were leased to the Board of Ordnance, who used Dudhope as a barracks for 95 years, from 1796 to 1879. Additional buildings were constructed, including a hospital, officers quarters, stables and guard-rooms. The castle building itself was used as accommodation for 400 soldiers. The Board of Ordnance finally abandoned the castle in 1881.[10]\nIn 1854 the town council of Dundee acquired a sub-lease on the castle grounds, for use as recreational facilities. The lease ran for 351⁄2 years for an annual rent of £25 until 1 November 1890. At this time the Earl of Home had intended to develop the grounds into terraced housing.\nInstead the council acquired the grounds for £31,700, raising £20,000 itself and the remaining being raised from generous citizens by Lord Provost Mathewson. The grounds were opened as a park on 28 September 1895 by Sir James Low.[10]\nThe building was later occupied by the Ministry of Works and was used as a military barracks during both the 1914–18 war and the 1939–45 war. A time gun was formerly located in the grounds of the castle and fired daily at 1pm. It ceased to be used in 1916 so as not do disturb patients at the nearby Dundee Royal Infirmary who were suffering from shell-shock.[11]\nRedevelopment\nThe castle passed to the corporation of Dundee who made an attempt to demolish the castle in 1958. In the years 1985 to 1988 the castle was redeveloped and is now in use as offices, a conference centre as well as housing the University of Abertay Dundee's Dundee Business School.[1] During restoration, one of the main rooms was designated as the Scrimgeour room. It is furnished with wall hangings pertinent to the Scrimgeours and the drapes on the windows are made from material in the Scrimgeour tartan as arranged by the Scrimgeour Clan Association that was officially organized on 5 June 1971. In March 1998 a special dinner was held by the Clan Association in memory of the 700th anniversary of a charter to the Scrimgeours signed by William Wallace on 29 March 1298 and later reaffirmed in another charter signed by Robert the Bruce on 5 December of that same year.\nReferences\nExternal links\nClan Scrimgeour\n56°27′52″N 2°59′2″W / 56.46444°N 2.98389°W / 56.46444; -2.98389\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

During the Scottish Wars of Independence it was held by the governor Sir Gilbert de Carrick (Gille Brighde) who surrendered it to the English. It was soon recovered by the forces of King Robert I of Scotland. In 1206 the Corrie family were the hereditary keepers of Castle Loch Doon, and 57 years later, owing to the marriage of Sir Robert Corrie to Lady Susanna Carlisle, added greatly to their possessions in Dumfriesshire. The castle later fell to the English and was re-captured in 1214. The castle was besieged in 1335. During the 14th century the castle was in the hands of the Kennedy family. The castle was taken from them by William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas after a siege in 1446. Having been given back to the Kennedy family the castle was again taken from them by William Crauford of Lefnoris in 1511. The castle was destroyed in the 16th century by King James V of Scotland as part of a general policy of reducing the power of the barons of Galloway.\nThe castle was dismantled and rebuilt on the side of the loch after the loch water level was raised in the 1930s for a hydro-electric scheme.[4]\nCitations\nExternal links Media related to Loch Doon Castle at Wikimedia Commons\nLoch Doon or Balliol Castle, East Ayrshire - Video footage of Loch Doon or Balliol Castle on YouTube\n55°13′26″N 4°22′42″W / 55.2238°N 4.3784°W / 55.2238; -4.3784\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Human settlement in Scotland\nRiccarton is a village and parish in East Ayrshire, Scotland. It lies across the River Irvine from Kilmarnock, this river forming the boundary between Riccarton and Kilmarnock parishes, and also between the historical districts of Kyle and Cunningham.[1] The name is a corruption of 'Richard's town', traditionally said to refer to Richard Wallace, the uncle of Sir William Wallace.[2] The parish also contains the village of Hurlford.[1]\nHistory\nThe village became a Burgh of Barony in 1638, but its civic powers were never exercised. Riccarton is also sometimes called Ellerslie.[3] In 1875 Riccarton had a population of 1889,[4] but by 1951 that had increased to between 7000 and 8000; many of whom were employed at the Glenfield Works in Kilmarnock.[5]\nRiccarton has effectively been absorbed into Kilmarnock, partly through the growth of council housing estates at Shortlees, Witchknowe and Burnpark, and later by the improvements to the A71 (T) road, the building of which, together with associated interchanges, effectively made the old village centre into a large traffic island.\nThe Barony of Riccarton\nThe ancient 109 merkland barony included 54 separate landholdings, including the coalheughs of Riccarton and all the buildings, orchards, woods, mills, and fishings (salmon and others). Riccarton and Shaws mill were included. Also the £17 lands of Kaimshill, Auchindinane and Hunthall, oddly also the £5 land of Elderslie in Renfrewshire, the 4 merklands of Inchgotrig and the 2 merklands of Holme.[6]\nThe churches\nA pre-reformation Riccarton parish church stood in the centre of the old burial ground; first noted, as a chapel, in 1229, sub-ordinate to the church of Dundonald.[7] It was granted by Walter, High Steward of Scotland, to the short-lived independent Gilbertine convent of Dalmulin. This convent was dissolved in 1238, and the 'chapel' given to the monastery of Paisley, becoming the parish church, which still belonged to the monks. The last patrons were the Cuninghames of Caprington, whose impressive memorial still stands; some of the Campbells of Treesbank are also interred here.[8][9] The old cemetery in 2007 Detail of memorial to Caprington Cuninghames. A memorial to Caprington Cuninghames. A memorial bearing a bodkin, shears and an iron.\nThe old cemetery has a number of interesting pre-reformation style gravestones, ornamented with scenes of men ploughing with oxen, one with a bodkin, shears and iron, another with millstones, wheels, and other gearing, and even a few with Garden of Eden scenes. The oldest discernible stone is marked 1641.[10] Unfortunately many are very worn and heraldic devices, etc. can no longer be made out with any certainty.\nFrom the presbytery records it would appear to have been rebuilt in 1725.[11] It was replaced by the present church (at NS 4282 3639) in 1823, which was built on the old Judgement or Moot hill of the barony of Riccarton. Of the old church in the small churchyard nearby, nothing now remains above ground, the stones being used to build a single story house close to the old bridge.[12]\nThe manse no longer exists, however it had a claim to significance in that it had a mantelpiece in its kitchen which came from the dining room of Riccarton castle.[13]\nSawney Moodie\nAlexander Moodie (1728–1799) was the Auld-Licht Protestant minister of Riccarton lampooned by Robert Burns. Burns has him preaching with hell-fire roaring, enough to send the Devil himself back to his hot hell in fright.[14] He was educated at Glasgow University and starting his ministry at Culross in 1759. He was buried in the Riccarton churchyard, but the present church wasn't built until 1823.[15]\nAlexander had a hyperactive and deafening preaching style.[16] Burns also references him in the Holy Fair[16] with :\nHis lengthen'd chin, his turned-up snout,\nHis eldritch squeel an' gestures,\nO how they fire the heart devout..\nThis was followed by a lampooning in \"The Kirk's Alarm\" where his swarthy complexion earned him the title of Singet Sawnie.[16] Burns wrote The Holy Tulzie in 1784 in response to a verbally violent dispute over parish boundaries between Alexander Moodie and the John Russel, minister of Kilmarnock's High Kirk.\nLocal worthies and eccentrics\nThe house built at the old bridge from the ruins of old Riccarton Kirk.\nGilbert de Grimsby was born at Riccarton and would have known William Wallace during his childhood. Gilbert's Scots nickname was 'Jop' and as a man of great stature and generally impressive appearance he was chosen by Edward I to carry the sacred banner of Saint John of Beverley at the head of the English army at the Battle of Dunbar in 1296 after voluntarily joining the English army. He had served under Edward in Flanders and Picardy and had been selected as a pursuivant or herald. On hearing of William Wallace's insurrection Gilbert deserted Edward and joined William's rebellion, bringing invaluable intelligence about the English army and being rewarded with the position of standard-bearer.[17]\nRiccarton Inn from the old cemetery.\nParts of Riccartoun with Kilmarnock in 1880.[18]\nThe Rev. Alexander Moodie, minister of the parish, is buried in the old cemetery. Robbie Burns mentions him in The Holy Fair.[19]\nSandy McCrone was a blind fiddler who is remembered for having climbed to the top of the new church when the scaffolding was still in place and placed a potato on the beak of the weathercock.[20]\nWilliam Stevenson was a local beggar who came from Dunlop. About 1787 he separated from his wife and made the unusual pledge that if either of them were to make an attempt at reconciliation then that person was to pay the other a £100; a considerable sum in those times. When he died it was found that he was worth around nine hundred pounds. He set aside money for all the beggars in Ayrshire to come and see his body lying in state and then enjoy a great feast in his honour.[21]\nSir James Shaw, Bart., a Lord Mayor of London was born at Mosshead farm on the Treesbank estate in 1764.[22] His statue now stands outside the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock.[23] Sir James endeared himself to Scotland by the active part which he took in raising money in London for the widow and children of Robbie Burns.[24]\nThe Seat of Judgement\nThe present 1823 parish church of Riccarton stands on a mound which is partly natural and partly artificial and which was formerly called \"Seat of Judgement\", having been a court or moot hill where justice was administered by the old baron court of Riccarton. Paterson in 1863 called it the \"Moat.\"[8][25] Soil from the foundations of the new church on the old moot hill was used to fill up part of the river bed when its course was changed at East Shaw Street, and this area though north of the Irvine still lies in Riccarton parish.[26] Witchknowe is an area of Riccarton named after a low hill. No definite site for the 'Gallow's hill' associated with the Moot hill has been identified and this is a candidate, together with the 'Castle hill.'\nThe 'Castle Hill' in 1895 was a round-topped mound with an oval base close to Damhead House. It was 26 paces in its longest diameter at the base, 15 feet (4.6 m) high on one side and 4-foot-6-inch (1.37 m) on the other. It was covered with trees and had a seat and a path to the top.[27]\nRiccarton Castle and the Sir William Wallace connection\nMain article: Bickering Bush\nYardside farm to the left was the site of Riccarton castle. The boys on Riccarton green are playing a game of the Scots and the English.[2]\nThe name Wallace was spelled in various ways, such as 'Waleys', 'Walensis', 'Walays', etc.[3] The family were the barons of Riccarton and it is said that Wallace's father was born here. Some go so far as to suggest that William Wallace himself was born in Riccarton.[28] After his murder of Selby, Governor of Dundee, William Wallace first sought refuge in Riccarton castle; another time being after he had revenged his uncle's death at the Barns of Ayr.[29]\nA little below the watermeetings[30] of the Irvine and the Kilmarnock Water took place a pivotal incident in 1297[31] which led to the Scottish Nation regaining its independence following what was effectively its conquest by Edward I of England.\nSir William Wallace was fishing on the Irvine at Monksholm also Maxholm farm,[32] about half a mile to the west of old Riccarton castle,[33] when a troop of English soldiers dismounted and demanded that he give up his catch. He offered to share, but this was refused and he was grossly insulted by the soldiers for his temerity. He had no weapons, however he used his fishing rod to disarm one soldier and then killed him with his own sword. He similarly dispatched two others and the remaining soldiers then fled. The Bickering Bush commemorated the site of the incident until the 19th century.\nHe went to his uncle's castle, the nearby Riccarton castle and took on the disguise of a woman working at her spinning-wheel, thereby eluding the vengeful English troops.[20] In the following months an uprising slowly gained impetus through the example of one unarmed Scotsman killing three armed soldiers.[30] A thorn tree called the \"Bickering Bush\" stood nearby and its site is marked on the 1860 OS map and a public house by that name used to stand in Riccarton, although another still exists in Bonnyton, Kilmarnock.[34][35]\nJohn Wallace of Riccarton married the heiress of Craigie Castle and this became the principal residence, the old castle being allowed to fall into ruins.[36] In 1875 all that remained of the castle was some stately trees, including a pear tree supposedly planted by William Wallace.[32]\nDeath at Riccarton's Nether ford\nAt the Nether Ford on the Irvine near Riccarton, Robert the Bruce in 1307 sent Sir James Douglas[37] to intercept the English soldiers commanded by Sir Philip de Mowbray. The English were ambushed as they crossed the ford on the Irvine and sixty lay dead before the survivors fled. Views of Riccarton kirk The old judgement hill at Riccarton, now topped by a church.

A milestone at the lazy corner near the parish kirk with directions to Kilmarnock, Hurlford, Galston and Ayr.[38][39] The Parish kirk on the moot hill.\nRiccarton old bridge\nRiccarton old bridge.\nRiccarton Bridge is an 18th-century 3-span, segmental arched bridge, with dressed stone arch rings, rubble spandrels and triangular cutwaters.[40] The bridge was widened in 1806. The first recorded wheeled vehicles to be used in Ayrshire were carts offered gratis to labourers working on Riccarton Bridge, Kilmarnock, in 1726, and even then some of the labourers refused them.[41][42] The 1860 OS map shows that stepping stones crossed the River Irvine just upstream of the old bridge and just before the confluence of the Kilmarnock water with the river Irvine. The 'New' Riccarton Bridge lies just downstream and dates from 1839 and was also widened.\nThe Toll Road\nRiccarton parish was often in dispute with the Kilmarnock to Cumnock committee over the payment of so-called 'conversion' money for the Toll Road maintenance. Even after recourse to law the committee still failed to obtain any money from Riccarton and Galston parishes.[43]\nRiccarton mill and cottages\nRiccarton Mill in the 1860s.\nAt Map reference: NS 4463 3701 lies the old Riccarton mill with its associated cottages. The mill wheel has gone and the building has been converted into a private house.[44] One miller was named Goudie and his son was likewise a miller in Alloway until he took a lease on Burns's Cottage and ran it as a pub.[45]\nRiccarton Institute\nJohn Galloway, Esq., of Barleith and Dollars Collieries built an institute in New Street Riccarton for the use of the working-men in the locality. The building still survives as a Community Centre run by East Ayrshire Council.[46]\nRiccarton and Craigie railway station\nThe branch leading towards the Scotfuels Depot\nMain article: Riccarton and Craigie railway station\nThe village had a railway station by this name on the Gatehead and Hurlford branch of the Glasgow and South Western Railway. Part of the line remains open to supply a petrol depot in Kilmarnock. The remains of the station were extant until the new Kilmarnock bypass removed all traces. It was a goods only station (no passengers) as the line never had a publicly advertised passenger service. It is listed in 1929 as 'Riccarton and Craigie' by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, one of the stations which the company conveyed goods to.[47] It closed officially on 5 July 1965, originally just called Riccarton and renamed in 1905.[48]\nBellfield Estate\nThe old walled garden.\nThis grand Georgian mansion and its 240 acres (0.97 km2) of woodlands and gardens, including a notable rock garden, were given to Kilmarnock by the Misses Buchanan, Elizabeth, Jane and Margaret, in around 1879. The ladies were the daughters of George Buchanan, a Glasgow merchant.[49] Bellfield housing scheme borders it.[50]\nThe Buchanan Bequest was donated by the Buchanan Family from Bellfield House. It contains only 100 titles, from the original 1,500 books donated, dating from 1759 to 1856; these can be found in the Ayrshire Collection at the Dick Institute. The Museum Service also has a number of items, including those on history, biographies, dictionaries, reference works, periodicals, general literature, poetry & theology, industry, agriculture & natural history, travel, topography & illustrated works.[51]\nIn the 1900s Walls[52] recalled that the Bellfield Park, adjoining, the beauty and beneficience of which touches every heart. Here flowers and plants are grown to perfection and every shrubbery cultivated and tree pruned to a nicety.\nThe house was demolished in 1970, much of the land was used for building council housing and the remainder is now used as a public park and playing fields.[49] Views of Bellfield in 2007 Woodlands near the old mansion house.

The Todgrige burn runs from near Muirmill Equestrian centre to join the Irvine at the Caprington Castle estate. Ainslie's map of 1821 shows a loch near Earlston, with a farm named Lochside.[53]\nCoal and limestone mining\nCoal existed in great abundance and was mined from a very early date. Anthracite or blind coal was chiefly mined and limestone was quarried for use as a 'manure' on the fields as well as for making mortar.[7]\nWhitehill Loch\nWhitehill or Hillhouse loch was located in a glacial kettle-hole above Whitehill Farm and although largely drained by the early 18th century it was used a curling site in the 19th century. A dwelling, now demolished, called Lochouse sat on the loch's outflow into the Little Sorn Burn.\nMicro-history\nIn 1848 James Young from the farm or small holding at Knowehead was murdered near Fortacres Farm by James McWheelan. He was killed whilst returning to the farm after a visit to his parents and family at Knowehead.\nRiccarton is also a locality to the south-west of Edinburgh, the site of Heriot-Watt University's main campus\nRiccarton Junction railway station was on the Waverley Route line built by the North British Railway. It closed in 1969.\nMr & Mrs. Campbell from Treesbank attended the Eglinton Tournament of 1839.[54]\nThe 'Peace and Plenty' was a tavern on the road to Ayr near Treesbank, sitting amongst a group of cottages. The pub and cottages have long gone, however the name remains. The publican was famous for providing a free kebbuck of cheese and a scone with lunchtime pints; a custom that was quite prevalent in various parts of Scotland and England up until the 1914-1918 war.[55]\nTemple Riccarton, Temple Croft, and Temple Easter Knowhead were parts of the Lainshaw, Kirkwood, and Bridgehouse Estate. The estate had rights of peat extraction from Riccarton Moss.[56]\nNotable residents\nJohn Deans, pioneer farmer in Canterbury, New Zealand[57]\nAlexander Allan Stevenson, Canadian businessman, politician and military officer\nSee also\nBlacksyke Tower\nCaprington Loch\nCraigie Castle, Ayrshire\nEarlston, East Ayrshire\nRiccarton, New Zealand\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Riccarton, East Ayrshire.\nRock Gardens - Bellfield Estate, Kilmarnock\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Fortress in Scotland\nDirleton Castle is a medieval fortress in the village of Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland. It lies around 2 miles (3.2 km) west of North Berwick, and around 19 miles (31 km) east of Edinburgh. The oldest parts of the castle date to the 13th century, and it was abandoned by the end of the 17th century.\nBegun in around 1240 by John De Vaux, the castle was heavily damaged during the Wars of Scottish Independence, when it was twice taken by the English. In the 14th century, Dirleton was repaired by the Haliburton family, and it was acquired by the Ruthvens in 1505. The Ruthvens were involved in several plots against Mary, Queen of Scots, and King James VI, and eventually forfeited the castle in 1600. Dirleton ceased to be a residence, although Oliver Cromwell was forced to besiege the castle to flush out a band of \"mosstroopers\" (marauders), during the Third English Civil War in 1650. The damaged castle was then acquired by John Nisbet, Lord Dirleton, who decided to build a new country house on the nearby Archerfield Estate. The Nisbet family of Dirleton continued to maintain the castle's gardens, before handing Dirleton into state care in 1923. The ruins and gardens are now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland.\nDirleton Castle stands on a rocky outcrop, at the heart of the rich agricultural lands of the barony of Dirleton, and guards the coastal approach to Edinburgh from England, via the port of North Berwick. The ruins comprise a 13th-century keep, and a 16th-century house which the Ruthvens built adjacent. Only the basement levels survive of the 14th- and 15th-century additions built by the Haliburtons, although these comprised a large hall and tower house along the east range. Other buildings within the courtyard have also been demolished. Surrounding the castle are gardens, which may have been first laid out in the 16th century, although the present planting is largely of the 20th century. The garden walls enclose a 16th-century doocot, or pigeon house.\nHistory\nde Vaux\nArms of de Vaux, Vaus, Vass, Vauss, etc., Latinised to de Vallibus, lairds of Dirletoun: Argent, a bend gules. De Vaux, Baron of Gilsland in Cumberland, bore arms: Argent, a bend checqy or and gules[1] Reconstruction drawing, by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, of the Château de Coucy, which probably influenced the design of Dirleton\nThe Norman family of de Vaux originated in Rouen, northern France, and settled in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066. Two de Vaux brothers, or cousins, were among a number of Anglo-Norman knights invited to Scotland, and granted land, by King David I of Scotland in the 12th century. Hubert de Vaux was given the barony of Gilsland in Cumbria, at that time part of Scotland, while John de Vaux was granted the barony of Dirleton. John built a castle at Eldbotle, probably to the north-west of modern Dirleton, and another, named Tarbet Castle, on the island of Fidra, although neither survives.[2]\nIn 1220, Fidra was gifted to the monks of Dryburgh Abbey by William de Vaux.[3] William's son, another John, had been held hostage in England as surety for the good conduct of King William the Lion in 1213, and succeeded to the barony in the 1220s.[3] He then began the construction of a replacement for Tarbet at Dirleton, which was recorded as a \"castellum\" in 1225,[4] although this may refer to an earlier timber structure.[5] In 1239, de Vaux was appointed seneschal, or steward, to Marie de Coucy, on her marriage to King Alexander II. Marie de Coucy was the daughter of Enguerrand III, Lord of Coucy (d.1242), builder of the Château de Coucy, in Picardy (c.1220s), which probably served as a model for Dirleton.[6] The 13th-century stone castle, of which only the donjon, or keep, remains, represented a show of de Vaux's status, and would have required peaceful times to permit a prolonged construction project.[7]\nPeaceful times ended in 1296, with the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence. Dirleton, which guarded the route between Edinburgh and the English border, changed hands several times through the invasions of the English under King Edward I. During the campaign of summer 1298, the castle was besieged by English forces under Antony Bek, the Bishop of Durham.[8] Dirleton withstood the assault for several months, until the English victory at Falkirk allowed them to bring up large siege engines, after which the castle was soon reduced.[9] Dirleton was garrisoned by the English, but must have been retaken by the Scots before 1306, when the English commander Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke recaptured Dirleton once more. It was finally retaken by the Scots some time before 1314, and was slighted, or deliberately damaged, to prevent its reuse by the English.[9]\nThe main gate, built in by the Haliburtons\nHaliburton\nThe castle and lands of Dirleton passed to the Berwickshire family of Haliburton (or Halyburton) when John Haliburton (d.1355) married the heiress of the de Vaux family, shortly before 1350. The castle had been repaired by 1363, when it was seized by William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas,[8] during his brief rebellion against King David II,[5] although it was later returned to the Haliburtons. In the 1420s, Sir Walter Haliburton (d. before 1447) acted as a hostage in exchange for the release of King James I, who had been held captive by the English since 1406.[8] He was rewarded in 1439 by being appointed Treasurer of Scotland.[10] Either Walter, or his eldest son John (d. before 1454), was ennobled as a Lord of Parliament in the 1440s, with the title Lord Dirletoun. The Haliburtons carried out extensive works at Dirleton, heightening the original towers, and constructing a new gatehouse to the south-east. A large hall and tower house were added to the castle in the 15th century, forming the east range.[8]\nKing James IV visited Dirleton in September 1505, and gave money to the masons then engaged on works in the north-east part of the castle.[5][8] Later that year, Patrick, the last Haliburton of Dirleton, died, and his estates were divided among his three daughters, Janet, Margaret, and Mariotta.[11] James IV made Patrick Haliburton's widow Christiane Wawane and her brother William Wawane keepers of Dirleton in August 1507.[12]\nRuthven\nThe Murder of David Rizzio, by Sir William Allan, depicting Lord Ruthven and others killing the Queen's secretary in her presence\nThe eldest daughter, Janet, married William Ruthven, 2nd Lord Ruthven (d. 1552) in 1515, and the castle and lordship of Dirleton passed to the Ruthven family. The son of William and Janet, Patrick, 3rd Lord Ruthven (c. 1520–1566), was one of the leaders of the group who murdered David Riccio, private secretary to Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566.[11] Patrick was forced to flee to England, where he died, leaving Dirleton to his son William (c. 1541–1584), who was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581. Lord Gowrie led a plot, later known as the Raid of Ruthven, in which the 16-year-old King James VI was seized, in August 1582. Ruthven then ruled in the king's name, while James was held captive. Although Gowrie was pardoned the following year, he was executed in 1584 for his part in another plot to seize Stirling Castle, and his lands were forfeited to the crown.[8] A keen amateur arboriculturalist, Lord Gowrie is thought to have laid out the gardens at Dirleton, and planted numerous trees.[5]\nAfter the attempted coup failed in May 1584, Dorothea Stewart, Countess of Gowrie, was commanded to surrender Dirleton, Ruthven, Cousland, and the Gowrie lodging in Perth to the crown.[13] James VI granted Dirleton to the Earl of Arran, who entertained the King there for twelve days in May 1585, while there was plague in Edinburgh.[14] The entertainment included a sumptuous banquet and a Robin Hood play.[15] The following year, the castle was restored to Dorothea Stewart, widow of the first Earl,[11] and by 1600 had passed to John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie (c. 1577–1600), their second son. Dorothea Stewart and her new husband Andrew Kerr of Faldonsyde complained in 1597 about a group of local men who stole rabbits from the links of Dirleton and terrorised her tenants. She was still living in the castle in November 1600.[16]\nDirleton played a role in the story of the “Gowrie Conspiracy” of 1600 in that there has long been suspicion that the castle was taken from the Ruthvens and given to Thomas Erskine as a reward for assisting James VI in the murder of Patrick Ruthven's sons: John, 3rd Earl of Gowrie, and his brother Alexander. The official narrative of the Gowrie Conspiracy, provided afterwards by the king, was that he and fifteen retainers, Erskine among them, had arrived at Gowrie House one night in August 1600 because he had been invited there by Alexander. However, as the narrative goes, the two brothers attempted to assassinate James, and in the melee that followed, the two Ruthvens were killed. While this was happening at Gowrie House, the other two Ruthven brothers, William and Patrick, were at Dirleton, apparently unaware of the plot afoot. Finding much to doubt in the king's account, many have argued that James went to Gowrie House with his retinue for the express purpose of murdering John and Alexander, partly because the king owed the Earl of Gowrie a large sum of money and partly because there had long been a rumor that Gowrie was the grandson of James IV, which, if true, would have put him in line for the throne ahead of James VI. After the killings, the king divided the Gowrie estates and bestowed them on the men who had been with him that night. Erskine received the gift of Dirleton Castle in November 1600, which some perceive to be a form of \"blood money\". This perception is further substantiated by the fact that Erskine was created Baron Erskine of Dirletowne in 1604.[17]\nErskine sold the castle to Sir James Douglas in 1625. Douglas sold it on to Alexander Morieson of Prestongrange,[5] who sold it in turn, in 1631, to James Maxwell of Innerwick (d. c. 1650), who was created Earl of Dirletoun in 1646.[8] In October 1641 the Earl of Argyll, Marquess of Hamilton and Earl of Lanark were forced to flee from Edinburgh to Dirleton, the home of Hamilton's mother-in-law, Elizabeth de Boussy, due the conspiracy known as the Incident.[18]\nCromwell\nOliver Cromwell's army invaded Scotland in 1650, during the Third English Civil War, and defeated the Scots Royalists at Dunbar on 3 September. With this victory, Cromwell gained effective control of southern Scotland, but bands of Royalist moss-troopers continued to harry the English supply lines. One such band was based at Dirleton, and Cromwell ordered General Monck and General Lambert, with 1,600 troops, to capture the castle. This was achieved on 10 November, using mortars to destroy the drawbridge and inner gate.[19] The captain of the moss-troopers was hanged from the walls with two of his comrades.[20] The castle was slighted once more, and although briefly used as a field hospital, it was then left to decay.[21] The soldier and engineer responsible for Cromwell's effective use of artillery was a German, Major Joachim Hane. He also designed fortresses near Inverness and in Ayr, and directed the mortar fire at the siege of Stirling Castle in August 1651. He later spent a year spying for Cromwell's Secretary of State, John Thurloe.[22]\nThe west flower garden\nNisbet\nDirleton Castle and estate were purchased, from the widowed Countess of Dirletoun, by the lawyer John Nisbet (c. 1609–1687) in 1663. Nisbet, who took the title Lord Dirleton when he was appointed as a judge, built a new house at Archerfield, to the north-west of the village. The Nisbets continued to maintain the gardens around the castle as part of the park around Archerfield, and installed the bowling green. The 19th-century garden walls were added by Mary Nisbet, Lady Elgin (1778–1855), wife of the Earl of Elgin, as part of a \"beautification\" of Dirleton village.[23] In the mid-19th century, two new parterres were laid out by the head gardener, David Thompson. Although neither survived, the west garden was restored, based on 19th-century plans, in 1993. The north garden was replaced in the 1920s with an Arts and Crafts-style garden of herbaceous borders.[24] Also in the 1920s, the castle was passed into state care, and is now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland, an agency of the Scottish Government.[5]\nThe castle and grounds are protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument,[25] while the gardens appear on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national register of historic gardens.[5] The castle, doocot, and boundary walls are Category A listed buildings, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland.[23]\nWitches of Dirleton Castle\nBetween 1649-50 almost 600 people in south and east Scotland (mainly women) were accused of witchcraft. Six were from Dirleton.[26]\nAgnes Clarkson\nIn June 1649, Agnes Clarkson, who was a widow, confessed to witchcraft after an interrogation (thought to be by the church court, or presbytery, led by John Makghie, the church minister of Dirleton Kirk). She said that had been visited by a woman from Longniddry who had already been burned for witchcraft, and later she had been visited by the devil himself \"in the liknesse of a black dun dogge and went up and doun the hous, and seised upon the said Agnes her cloths, and therafter, turning into the liknesse of a black man, had carnall copulation with her.”.[26] She became the devil's servant, and attended “a meeting of the devil and sundrie others with him upon the green of Diriltoun”. She named the other people who were there and had danced with the devil. She accused Patrick Watson of nearby West Fenton, his wife Manie Halieburton, and Bessie Hogge. Her evidence led to the witches trial. It was likely she was held in Dirleton castle's pit prison.[26]\nManie Halieburton and Patrick Watson\nManie Halieburton was accused of witchcraft by her husband Patrick Watson and by Agnes Clarkson. She confessed to having been tricked by the devil eighteen years previously. When their daughter was sick, the devil appeared as a man who claimed to be a physician. They had fed him and paid him she had \"had carnall copulatioun\" with him, when Patrick was out. So she became the devil's servant.[26]\nThe trial included being assessed by the 'witch pricker' John Kincaid, who searched for a part of the accused body which was not subject to pain, or other 'devil's mark' bodily signs to be used as evidence that they were indeed witches. Kincaid said \"I fand the divellis marke upon the baksyde of the said Patrik Watson a little under the point of his left shoulder, and upon the left syde of the said Meinie Halliburton hir neck a little abone hir left shoulder, whairof they wer not sensible, nether came furth thairof any bloode.”[26]\nBessie Hogge, Marione Meik and Margaret Goodfellow\nThe evidence against these three women, has not survived, but they were accused of dancing with the devil or otherwise participating in a relationship with him.\nDirleton Castle, Great Hall (detail)\nThe trials took place in the Dirleton Castle Great Hall, and although the sentence and action taken do not survive either, those accused were usually executed, as required by law,[27] often by strangling. [26] Official apology\nNicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, issued an officially apology for the first time, for the persecution of alleged witches during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.[28]\nDescription\nFloor plans of the castle.

Y Lord's chamber, base of tower house.\nThe castle is built on a natural rocky outcrop, on a low ridge overlooking the farmland of East Lothian. It comprises a kite-shaped courtyard, 40 metres (130 ft) by 27 metres (89 ft), flanked by buildings on the south and east sides. The most substantial remains are the Ruthven Lodging, the gatehouse, and the de Vaux keep to the south, while only the basement of the east range survives. Fragments of the north and west curtain walls outline the courtyard, which was formerly divided in two by further 16th-century buildings. The castle was originally approached from the south, via a bridge and 3.4-metre (11 ft) drawbridge, across a 15-metre (49 ft) wide ditch. In the 16th century, steps were built to access the Ruthven lodging from the west.[4]\nThe keep\nThe keep, or donjon, survives largely intact from the 13th century, and forms the south-west part of the present castle. Described by architectural historian W. D. Simpson as a \"cluster keep\",[29] it comprises a large round tower to the south, a smaller round tower to the west, with the two joined by a square tower. The masonry is of squared ashlar, or dressed stone blocks. Internally, the original use of the rooms is difficult to interpret,[4] although the round towers may have served as private suites for Lord Dirleton and his Lady.[30] The large tower contains a six-sided chamber at ground level, possibly a kitchen, with a seven-sided main chamber above. This room has a pointed vaulted ceiling, window seats in the large windows around the south wall, and a carved fireplace at the north. To the east is a postern, or side door, and beyond is a well. Adjacent to the well is a floor hatch, which would have allowed food to be transferred directly from the kitchen to a servery above.[31] A room in the square tower to the west, possibly the lord's bedroom,[8] has holes in the ceiling to allow smoke from braziers to escape. The more ruined west round tower probably contained another hall, with chambers above and storage below.[30] In the 17th century, the top of the main round tower was lowered and remodelled to form a gun platform.[32]\nOnly fragments of the rest of the 13th-century castle remain. A fourth tower, where the Ruthven lodging now stands, may have completed the \"cluster keep\".[8] Bases of round towers at the south-east and north-east corners of the castle are visible below the later walls. Parts of the north-west wall are 13th-century work, as is the blocked postern in the basement of the east range.[8] The overall plan of the castle, however, was not greatly changed through later rebuilding work. Dirleton is the earliest dated example in Scotland of a castle with round towers that project beyond the curtain wall, as opposed to those at Dunstaffnage, for example, where the towers are contained within the walls.[7] This new form was subsequently used in other 13th-century Scottish castles, including Bothwell and Kildrummy.[7]\nVaulted basement of the east range\nThe east range and gatehouse\nThe gatehouse, kitchens, and east range were built by the Haliburtons in the 14th and 15th centuries. The gatehouse, built in the 14th century to the east of the keep, is similar to the one at nearby Tantallon Castle.[8] It is fronted by a high, pointed arch, formerly with bartizans, small round turrets, at the top. The gate was protected by a drawbridge over the outer ditch, a portcullis, and three sets of doors. Guard rooms open off the entrance passage, and a round opening in the roof, known as a \"murder hole\", allowed defenders to drop objects on to any attacker who breached the outer gate.[33]\nThe large kitchens occupy the south-east angle of the castle. The 9-metre (30 ft) high main kitchen has two 4-metre (13 ft) wide fireplaces for cooking, and a circular vent in the vaulted ceiling.[4] Hatches in the floor give access to a well (11.5 metres (38 ft) deep) and cellars below. The adjacent passage linked the kitchen to the hall in the east range.\nRemains of the hall and the basement of the tower house\nThe east range itself runs the length of the east side of the castle, and originally comprised a large hall, with a square tower house at the north-east corner. Although only the basement survives, this once formed one of the finest noble residences of its time in Scotland, and would have been similar to the contemporary buildings at Doune Castle.[34] The basement is a single tunnel vault, with low walls subdividing the area into stores. Two large ovens and a well lie at the south end, while at the east is the 13th-century postern, blocked when the wall was thickened to support the new buildings above, and re-used as a fireplace.[35] At the north end of the basement is a vaulted prison for freemen, and below this, a rock-cut pit, 3 metres (9.8 ft) square, to house prisoners of the peasant classes.[35] Above the prison, but still within the basement, is a vaulted chapel with various ceremonial recesses, such as a sacristy and a piscina, or water basin.[35] A private chamber for the priest is next door. The hall above is 22 metres (72 ft) by 7.5 metres (25 ft),[29] and once had a high timber roof, and a minstrel's gallery at the south end. An ornately carved stone buffet, or cupboard, is located on this wall, which formed part of the servery next to the kitchen.[35] At the north-east corner of the castle, a tower house provided accommodation for the Lord's family and guests. Again, only the lowest floor remains, above the chapel. This probably formed a private chamber for the Lord, and was connected to the adjacent hall.[35]\nThe north façade of the Ruthven Lodging\nThe Ruthven Lodging\nConstructed by the Ruthvens after they acquired the castle around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging represents the final stage of building at Dirleton. In the later part of the 16th century, it served as the main residence of Lady Dorothea, wife of the first Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 children.[36] The three-storey building is constructed, like the Haliburton range, from undressed stone, although the Ruthven Lodging is decorated with string courses, horizontal mouldings running around the walls. The large windows were protected by iron grilles and small gun holes.[36] The rectangular Lodging is immediately to the north of the de Vaux building, separated by a narrow irregular courtyard, which is accessed via a passage in the ground floor of the Lodging. The remainder of the ground floor was occupied by cellars, with family rooms and bedrooms on the upper floors. The first-floor dining room was paved with patterned floor tiles, and may once have had a painted timber ceiling.[36]\nThe gardens\nThe 16th-century doocot\nThe castle is set within extensive gardens, bounded by a 19th-century wall. The gardens were first laid out in the 16th century, but have undergone many changes. A bowling green lies to the west of the castle, fringed by yew trees, which may once have formed a hedge around a parterre in this area.[37] West of the bowling green is a flower garden, laid out in 1993 to an 18th-century design, and containing yew, cedar, monkey puzzle and Lawson's cypress trees. To the north is the 1920s Arts and Crafts garden, which is home to a 215-metre (705 ft) -long herbaceous border, and is overlooked by a castellated 19th-century gazebo, or summer house. The border is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as being the longest in the world. The rest of the gardens comprise lawns, with numerous mature specimen trees, including redwood, beech, and sycamore.[5]\nThere is a well-preserved 16th-century beehive-shaped doocot, or pigeon house, in the castle grounds. The doocot is 7.6 metres (25 ft) high, and contains around 1000 nesting boxes for pigeons, which were an important source of food for the castle's inhabitants. To the north-east, now located outside the castle gardens, is a 16th-century gateway which formerly served the castle, but now serves the adjacent farm.\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography\nLindsay, Maurice.

    "text": "Fortress overlooking the harbour of Dunbar, Scotland\nDunbar Castle was one of the strongest fortresses in Scotland, situated in a prominent position overlooking the harbour of the town of Dunbar, in East Lothian. Several fortifications were built successively on the site, near the English-Scottish border. The last was slighted in 1567; it is a ruin today.\nStructure\nThe body of buildings measured in excess of 165 feet (50 m) from east to west, and in some places up to 210 feet (64 m) from north to south. The South Battery, which Grose supposes to have been the citadel or keep, is situated on a detached perpendicular rock, only accessible on one side, 72 feet (22 m) high, and is connected to the main part of the castle by a passage of masonry measuring 69 feet (21 m). The interior of the citadel measures 54 by 60 feet (16 m × 18 m) within the walls. Its shape is octagonal. Five of the gun-ports remain, which are called the 'arrow-holes'. They measure 4 feet (1.2 m) at the mouth and only 16 inches (41 cm) at the other end. The buildings are arched and extend 8 feet (2.4 m) from the outer walls, and look into an open court, whence they derive their light.[1]\n19th-century engraving of the castle\nAbout the middle of the fortress, part of a wall remains, through which there is a gateway, surmounted with armorial bearings. This gate seems to have led to the principal apartments. In the centre, are the arms of George, 10th Earl of Dunbar, who succeeded his uncle in 1369, and who besides the earldom of Dunbar and March, inherited the Lordship of Annandale and the Isle of Man from his heroic aunt, Black Agnes of Dunbar. They must have been placed there after his succession, as he was the first who assumed those sculptured Arms: viz, a large triangular shield, and thereon a lion rampant, within a bordure charged with eight roses. The shield is adorned with a helmet, carrying a crest: a horse's head bridled. On the right are the Arms of the Bruces, and on the left those of the Isle of Man.[1]\nThe castle towers had communication with the sea, and dip low in many places. North-east from the front of the castle is a large natural cavern, chiefly of black stone, which looks like the mouth of the Acheron – a place that leads to melancholy streams. This spot is supposed to have formed part of the dungeon where prisoners were confined, such as Gavin Douglas, Bishop of Dunkeld, who was a prisoner here in 1515. There is, however, also a dark postern which gives access to a rocky inlet from the sea, and it seems probable that it was through this that Sir Alexander Ramsay and his followers entered with a supply of provisions to the besieged in 1338.[1]\nIt was long said the castle was invulnerable, possibly because of the many sieges it sustained. The castle was built with a red stone similar to that found in the quarries near Garvald. Large masses of walls, which have fallen beneath the weight of time, appear to be vitrified or run together. In the north-west part of the ruins is an apartment about 12 feet (3.7 m) square, and nearly inaccessible, which tradition states was the apartment of Mary, Queen of Scots.[1]\nHistory\nEarly history\nThe Votadini or Gododdin are thought to have been the first to defend this site as its original Brythonic name, dyn barr, means 'the fort of the point'. By the 7th century, Dunbar Castle was a central defensive position of the Kings of Bernicia, an Anglian kingdom that took over from the British Kingdom of Bryneich.\nNorthumbria\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, Dunbar Castle was held by an Ealdorman owing homage to either the Kings at Bamburgh Castle, or latterly the Kings of York. In 678 Saint Wilfrid was imprisoned at Dunbar, following his expulsion from his see of York by Ecgfrith of Northumbria.\nLater, Dunbar was said to have been burnt by Kenneth MacAlpin, King of the Scots. Certainly he is on record in possession of the castle.[2]\nKingdom of the Scots\nIn the 10th and early 11th centuries, the Norsemen made increasing inroads in Scotland and in 1005 a record exists of a Patrick de Dunbar, under Malcolm II, engaged against the Norse invaders in the north at Murthlake a town of Marr where alongside Kenneth, Thane of the Isles, and Grim, Thane of Strathearn, he was slain.[2]\nThe first stone castle is thought to have been built by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria, after his exile from England, following the Harrowing of the North, by William the Conqueror after Gospatric took refuge at the court of Malcolm III of Scotland. Gospatric was a powerful landowner in both kingdoms and could summon many men, which encouraged Malcolm to give him more lands in East Lothian, the Merse and Lauderdale, as recompense for those lost further south and in return for loyalty as is usual under the feudal system. Sir Walter Scott argued that Cospatric or Gospatrick was a contraction of Comes Patricius. In any case, King Malcolm III is recorded as bestowing the manor of Dunbar &c., on \"the expatriated Earl of Northumberland\".[2]\nIn June 1338, Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie relieved Dunbar Castle and assisted the Countess of Dunbar (\"Black Agnes of Dunbar\"). Together they successfully defended the castle against the siege by William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury of England.\nJames IV\nThe castle remained the stronghold of the Earls of Dunbar until the forfeiture of George, Earl of March, in 1457, when the Castle was dismantled to prevent its occupation by the English. It was restored by James IV later in the century. Andrew Wood of Largo was the keeper.[3] In April 1497 timber was bought for the \"Hannis tower\" and the master mason Walter Merlioun was completing the gatehouse or \"fore work\". Nails were bought for the \"yetts\" of the gatehouse, a wooden portcullis and a metal grille or yett made by Thomas Barker. John the Quarrier excavated a new well.[4] James IV visited in April 1497 and gave the masons drinksilver reward payments in May.[5]\nBuilding lime was brought from Cousland.[6] The hinges or \"crukis\" for the iron yett were made in the forge at Edinburgh Castle.[7] A carpenter, Patrick Falconer, measured the roof or ceiling of the king's chamber at Edinburgh castle to make a similar roof at Dunbar.[8] In August 1497 two Dunbar carpenters, William Young and Thomas Makachane, started to roof the Hannis tower. In September it was finished by Andrew the \"Sclater\". Slates and rafters were brought to Dunbar in Will Merrymowth's boat.[9] In 1501 new iron window grills or yetts were provided.[10]\nAndrew Forman, Bishop of Moray, was made keeper of Dunbar Castle in September 1503.[11] Ferquhard Mackintosh, an heir to the Lordship of the Isles, was held prisoner in the castle for over ten years.[12]\nJames Stewart, Duke of Albany\nThe castle came under the control of the Duke of Albany during the minority of James V. The garrison of 100 French soldiers was paid by Francis I of France, who sent their wages to the quartermaster Maurice de Nogent.[13] During this period the artillery bulwark to the west was built.[14] It may have been designed by Antoine d'Arces, Sieur de la Bastie who was placed in charge of the castle in December 1514.[15] Albany organised further repairs and amendments in June 1527.[16]\nAn Italian drawing for a fortification of this period by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, marked as an opinion for \"il Duca D'Albania,\" has been associated with Dunbar.[17] An article by the historian Bryony Coombs further explores the activities of the Duke of Albany and his architectural and artistic connections that informed the design of the blockhouse and situates the building in a European context, and highlights the resemblance of the drawing to the Fort de Salses as built for Ferdinand II of Aragon.[18]\nJames V\nJames V came to the castle frequently in the summer of 1537 after the death of his first wife, Madeleine of Valois, and oversaw the arrangement of his artillery. A Scottish courtier James Atkinhead was installed as Captain.[19] In 1540, Aitkenhead's garrison included a number of foreign artillery and handgun experts, including Master Wolf, Morso or Marco of Armorica who was the armourer, Peter Cumbo, Tibo Rukour, John Rubino, Peter Schoffett.[20] Patrick Wemyss of Pittencrieff was captain of the castle in 1542 and spent £100 Scots on repairs.[21]\nRough Wooing\nIn July 1545 the Earl of Angus mentioned that Edinburgh Castle had been re-fortified, \"but as for Dunbar he heard of nothing done to it\".[22] French money amounting to £1,370 in 1546 was sent to fund repairs to the castle in 1546.[23] In August 1547 the cannon called \"Thrawynmouth\" was shipped from Dunbar for use at the siege of St Andrews Castle.[24] Repair works were carried out by Robert Hamilton of Briggis.[25]\nThe castle was burnt by the Earl of Shrewsbury on a punitive raid during the Rough wooing in 1548.[26] A French soldier, Monsieur La Chapelle was made keeper of the castle on 18 June 1548 and William Hamilton of Humby was captain.[27] Further re-fortifications in 1548 were directed by Piero Strozzi and Migliorino Ubaldini.[28][29] Regent Arran ordered a mason John Arthur to come from Haddington to work on the castle.[30]\nThe English soldier Thomas Holcroft described the activities of Peter Landstedt, a lieutenant of the German mercenary Courtpennick (Konrad Pennick), on 24 September 1549. Despite cannon fire from the castle, Landstedt got a foothold in a house in Dunbar, and used the furniture to start fires in the town. Landstedt planned to make an entrenchment in front of the castle to place his guns, and he thought the walls of the castle near the town were \"very old and low,\" and now \"revised with earth and mounds\", these old walls being stone on the natural rock. He thought the old high walls of the inner court could be broken by bombardment to destroy the \"first walls\" of the castle. These plans were not realised.[31] Regent Arran gave a tip to \"devisaris and draweris of the fort\", setting out a new fortification in December 1550.[32] The French soldier and writer, Jean de Beaugué, described the castle and its proximity to key sites in the war:The castle is a very handsome and strong place built on a lofty rock on the edge of the sea, very difficult of approach, and on which so much art has been displayed, that few places are to be found anywhere at the present time, which are by nature more commodious, less exposed to battery, and all other methods of storming, than this castle, which besides, is sufficiently near Lauder, Dunglass, Haddington, Eyemouth, Fast Castle, and the sea road of North Berwick and the Bass.[33]\nReformation crisis\nDuring her Regency, Mary of Guise employed an Italian military engineer called Lorenzo Pomarelli.[34] The French ambassador in London, Antoine de Noailles advised her to strengthen and repair her fortresses including Dunbar.[35] Mary of Guise came to Dunbar Castle in June 1559 in fear of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation who occupied Edinburgh.[36] Guise sent money to French captain of Dunbar, Corbeyran de Sarlabous, for two week's wages for workmen in April 1560.[37] In May, an Italian engineer was working on further improvements for the French garrison.[38] These works were inspected by Robert Hamilton in Briggs, keeper of Linlithgow Palace and Master of the Royal Artillery, and Robert Montgomery in July 1560, after the death of Mary of Guise, on behalf of the Lords of the Congregation who reported that the Castle was \"more ample by the double than it was of before\" and capable of holding 500 more soldiers. The new work was immediately demolished as a provision of the Treaty of Edinburgh. 100 English workmen called \"pioneers\" were sent to the castle in August.[39] Local landowners were tasked with the demolition of part of a \"rampire,\" a rampart with its ditch and counter scarp, and a great platform for artillery.[40] However, the French captain, Corbeyran de Sarlabous, remained in charge of the castle and refurbished a cavern which was within the area scheduled for demolition.[41] The rebel Lord Sempill found a refuge in the castle in August 1560. The Castle remained garrisoned by 60 French troops under the command of Sarlabous until September 1561.[42]\nMary, Queen of Scots\nMary, Queen of Scots made Robert Anstruther captain of Dunbar in July 1561. He took charge of the cannons and ammunition according to an inventory made by Robert Hamilton of Briggs.[43] Soon after her return to Scotland in August 1561, she appointed her half-brother Lord John keeper of the castle. In November 1561 John Chisholm, comptroller clerk of the royal artillery provided six culverins. The master of work William MacDowall and David Rowan, an expert gunner from Edinburgh castle surveyed the fort.[44] Mary stayed at Dunbar with Lord John on 30 December 1562.[45] Chisholm shipped cannon and gun carriages from Dunbar north to Aberdeen and back in October 1562 during operations against the Earl of Huntly.[46]\nMary appointed Simon Preston of Craigmillar captain of Dunbar. She visited in February 1564 and came to stay at the castle for a week in November 1564.[47] In August 1565, during the rebellion against Mary, Queen of Scots called the Chaseabout Raid, she ordered repairs to the gun emplacements and artillery, and hand tools that might be needed to re-build the ramparts during a siege.[48] She was brought to the castle by the Earl of Bothwell and then confronted her enemies at the battle of Carberry Hill on 15 June 1567.\nThere was a siege in September 1567 to eject Bothwell's supporters and the captain, Patrick Whitelaw or Quhytelaugh. The bakers and butchers of Haddington were summoned to supply the camp, and brewers were ordered to bring ale.[49] John Chisholm brought guns from Edinburgh Castle.[50] William Kirkcaldy of Grange was made keeper of the castle on 1 October.[51]\nSlighting and demolition\nDunbar Castle was finally slighted by order of the Parliament of Scotland in December 1567. Dunbar and the fortress on Inchkeith were to be \"cast down utterly to the ground and destroyed in such a way that no foundation thereof be the occasion to build thereupon in time coming.\"[52] The Historie of King James the Sext notes the order to demolish the \"king's hous of strenthe.\"[53] William Drury reported that Regent Moray was prevented from finishing the demolition in January 1568, as the master carpenter (probably Andrew Mansioun) estimated the work would cost £2000 Scots. It was said that the same sum spent on rebuilding would make it \"one of the strongest places in Scotland\".[54] In September 1568, some of the stone was selected for reuse at the quayside of the Shore of Leith.[55]\nSee also\nList of places in East Lothian\nReferences\nExternal links\nHistoric Environment Scotland. \"Dunbar Castle (57687)\".

    "text": "Building in East Lothian in Scotland\nFa'side Castle (Faside Estate) has previously been known as Fawside, Falside, Ffauside, Fauxside, or Fawsyde and is a 15th-century keep located in East Lothian in Scotland. The castle is approximately 2 miles (3 kilometres) southwest of Tranent, and 2 mi (3 km) southeast of Musselburgh. The building was restored in the 1980s and is now protected as a category B listed building.[1]\nHistory\nThe name dates from 1189, when the monks of Newbattle Abbey granted land to Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester to build the castle on the site. It was in the possession of Alan la Zouche, 1st Baron la Zouche of Ashby, the son in law of Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester, on behalf of his wife, when it was besieged by Sir William Douglas in 1288. The land was lost to Robert the Bruce after the De Quincy family declared their loyalty to Edward I of England. Bruce granted the lands to the Seton family.\nThe Fawsydes of that Ilk acquired land in the area from the Setons in 1371.[2] The earliest part of the present building was constructed by the Fawsydes in the 15th century.[1]\nThe castle was burned by the English before the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, which was fought nearby on 10 September 1547, suffocating or burning all those inside. Mary, Queen of Scots left Fa'side on the morning of 15 June 1567 for the Battle of Carberry Hill. She changed into a short skirt and left her fine clothes behind in a chest.[3]\nThe castle was rebuilt and extended to the south in the late 16th century.[1] A surviving oak bed, now at Biggar Museum, was made for Margaret Fawside, who married Patrick Levingstone of Saltcoats near Gullane.[4]\nOn 5 November 1620 a number of local and neighbouring landowners had dinner with Janet Lawson, Lady Fawside, at the castle and illegally combined together to set and raised the price of coals from their coalmines. The Privy Council of Scotland found their actions unlawful and the lairds were ordered to pay a fine of £2,000 and be imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. In defence the landowners claimed their coal was unprofitable, that the workings of Little Fawside (belonging to the Master of Elphinstone) were on fire, and the Fawside coal mine had bankrupted the old laird.[5]\nThe Fawsydes sold the castle in 1631 to an Edinburgh burgess and merchant called Hamilton. By the 19th century it had fallen into ruin, and was close to being demolished altogether in the 1970s. However, the castle was bought and restored by Thomas Moodie Craig. Author and historian Nigel Tranter set up the Fa'side Restoration Society in 1970 through the St. Andrews Society of East Lothian, and introduced Craig to the castle in 1975. After investigation it was discovered that the original name of the castle was Fawside Castle. The restoration work began in 1976 was completed by 1982. The castle remains in private ownership. Faside Estate includes a stud farm and a bed & breakfast business. The building has five bedrooms while the tourist accommodation is in a tower and two cottages.[6]\nDescription\nFa'side is a 7,411 square feet (688.5 m2) L-plan building, being a fifteenth-century four-storey keep with a later turreted block added. There is a vaulted basement. The castle stands on a high ridge with extensive views over East Lothian and the Firth of Forth.\nAdditional Photos\nSee also\nRestoration of castles in Scotland\nReferences\nBibliography\nCoventry, Martin (2001) The Castles of Scotland.

    "text": "Luffness House in 2019.\nLuffness Castle, also known as Luffness House, is a house built in a former fortification near the village of Aberlady, East Lothian, Scotland.\nHistory\nThe lands around the current house were a part of the estates of the Gospatrick Earls of Lothian, but in the 12th Century they were given to the Lindsay family in marriage and this family constructed a castle on the site in the 13th century, this was described as a large and strong fortress. Some of the property was donated to the Church as a memorial to Sir David Lindsay, High Chamberlain of Scotland in 1256 and a Regent for Alexander III, who died on crusade which was under the leadership of Louis of France. On his deathbed Sir David promised to donate land for a religious house so long as his remains were returned to Scotland. A Carmelite friary was then built nearby in 1293 and remnants of the priory still exist overgrown within the woods. Edward I and an English army occupied the castle in 1311. It was sacked in 1547 by an English force under the command of Edward Clinton, Lord Clinton.\nThe English army treasurer and diplomat Ralph Sadler advised the Earl of Shrewsbury that a new fort at Aberlady would support an English garrison to be installed nearby inland at Haddington. There were also suggestions that an English fort should be built for this purpose at \"White-castell\" at Nunraw or on the \"Pethes\", a narrow route between hills in Scotland.[1]\nFrench and Scots soldiers, directed by Paul de Thermes, built a fort here in 1549 to interrupt the English supply to their garrison at Haddington.[2] On 23 June 1549 Regent Arran summoned neighbouring villagers to fight off English soldiers trying to prevent the buildings work. On 25 June Arran requested the lairds of East and West Lothian to provide labourers. The royal treasurer's accounts refer to the \"fort of Aberlady\". Oxen dragged guns from the fort to the nearest harbour in January 1550 for shipping to Monifieth, to be used against Broughty Castle.[3] This fort was demolished on the orders of Marie de Guise in 1552.\nIn the second half of the 16th Century the ownership of Luffness was transferred to the Hepburn Earls of Bothwell who rebuilt the castle and in the 17th century the estate change ownership again to the Durham family while an Adam Duff of Luffness is recorded in 1704. In 1739 the Hope Earl of Hopetoun bought Luffness and in 1822 the castle and was altered and extended by William Burn with the further works carried out under the direction of David Bryce in 1846 and 1874. Today the house is well maintained, and is still occupied by the Hope family.[4]\nFriary remains, Luffness (geograph 2218928)\nDescription\nLuffness House is presently a tower house of three storeys with an attic and it forms a T shape with the square turret forming its stem. There is a turnpike stair which occupies the first two floors. Nigel Tranter thought that this stair incorporated what was left of the castle, and is likely from the 13th century.[5] The house is situated at the northwestern angle of a square fortification which is delineated by a partially infilled ditch which may be a remnant of the French built fortifications from 1549, or it may be the remains of the earlier castle.[6]\nSee also\nList of places in East Lothian\nReferences\nBibliography\nLindsay, Maurice The Castles of Scotland, Constable & Co. 1986\nCoventry, Martin The Castles of Scotland, Goblinshead 1995\nExternal links\nLuffness Castle website\n56°00′51″N 2°50′38″W / 56.0141°N 2.8440°W / 56.0141; -2.8440\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in East Lothian, Scotland, UK\nSaltoun Hall\nSaltoun Hall North Lodge\nSaltoun Hall is an historic house standing in extensive lands off the B6355, Pencaitland to East Saltoun road, about 1.5 miles from each village, in East Lothian, Scotland. The house is reached by way of an impressive gateway and is situated at grid reference NT461685.\nHistory\nSaltoun Hall began life, in the 12th century, as a tower or castle[1] and, at that time, was in the hands of the powerful de Morville family. Hugh de Morville was granted lands in the 12th century by King David I at Saltoun and his family were created hereditary High Constables of Scotland.[2] Hugh de Morville was famed for his patronage of religious establishments: he founded Dryburgh Abbey in the old county of Roxburghshire around 1150.[3]\nBy 1260, Sir William Abernethy owned the lands and castle at Saltoun, and his descendant Sir Lawrence Abernethy was created Lord Saltoun in 1445. The Abernethys were owners at Saltoun for nearly 400 years but in 1643, the estates were bought by Andrew Fletcher, Lord Innerpeffer, to whose family the land still belongs.[2] His grandson Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun (1655–1716) is remembered for his opposition to the Acts of Union 1707.[4]\nSaltoun Hall Doocot\nOver the years, Saltoun Castle was spared trouble and there is only one recorded incident at the castle. In 1548, during Somerset's occupation of Haddington, John Cockburn of Ormiston held the castle for the English commander Grey of Wilton. Cockburn was an 'assured' Scot, one who agreed with the English point of view during the \"Rough Wooing\" campaign. The castle was quickly retaken in February 1548 by the Earl of Arran, who brought artillery from Edinburgh castle, and hanged 5 of Cockburn's men and took 5 prisoner.[5]\nThere were many extensions, changes and renewals at the castle but there are no records until the days of the Fletcher family. In 1769, Lord Fletcher added a new wing on the south side of the building. A separate extension was built for the library in 1779. This created an L-shaped house and a 'great stair' was built in the angle. In 1803, architect Robert Burn designed new turrets on the corners giving the 'new' house a castellated appearance. His son, William Burn, completely transformed the building on a large scale in 1817, creating what was described as a 'bleak magnificence'. A large square turret was added. The interior is in the Gothic Revival style, with rib vaulting throughout. A new corridor was built to provide a Gothic gallery and rooms were recast in a Grecian style. The house was sold in the late 1960s and subdivided into apartments.[6] The Fletchers sold the building and some of the estate but the family still live nearby. Today's house owes much to the architectural style of William Burn. The house is said to be haunted by a 'grey lady'.[1]\nSaltoun Hall was famed for a formally designed garden in the 19th century.[7] Botanist David McHattie Forbes served as Foreman Forester for the estate from 1883 until his departure for Hawaii in 1887.\nListed buildings\nThe house is a category A listed building[8] and the doocot is listed at category B.[9]\nReferences\nExternal links\nSaltoun Hall Official Page\n55°54′21″N 2°51′49″W / 55.9059°N 2.8637°W / 55.9059; -2.8637\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle ruins in East Lothian, Scotland\nYester Castle is a ruined castle, located 1+1⁄2 miles (2.5 kilometres) southeast of the village of Gifford in East Lothian, Scotland. The only remaining complete structure is the subterranean Goblin Ha' or Hobgoblin Ha' (Goblin Hall).[1] It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, recorded as such by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.[2]\nYester castle is on private land and is not open to the public.\nHistory\nThe tower in 1814\nOriginally known as Yestred (from the Brythonic Ystrad, meaning strath or dale), the barony of Yester was granted by King William the Lion to Hugo de Giffard, a Norman immigrant given land in East Lothian during the reign of King David I. Latin language documents note the location as Zester in vital records.[3]\nThe original stone keep, built before 1267, is generally considered to be by Sir Hugo de Giffard. A grandson of the first Laird of Yester, he served as a guardian of the young Alexander III of Scotland, and was by repute a magician and necromancer. Alexander III is known to have been at Yester on and around 24 May 1278, where he corresponded with Edward I of England. Following the Scots Wars of Independence, Yester was rebuilt as a castle of enceinte.\nIn 1298, during the Battle of Falkirk, Alexander de Welles, Master of Torphichen Preceptory, was killed. Based on the heraldic evidence there is very little doubt that Alexander de Welles was a member of the Lincolnshire Welle(s) family. Also at Falkirk was Adam de Welle(s) of Lincolnshire and of the Castle of Yester in Lothian, to whom the English King Edward I, during his occupation of Scotland, gave various properties confiscated from the Lothian nobility and gentry.[4]\nIn 1357, there being no male line left of the Giffards, Joanna, a daughter and co-heiress, of the last Sir Hugo de Giffard, married Sir William [or Thomas] de la Haye of Peebles, of Locherworth (Locherwart), the Sheriff of Peebles. He was invested with the barony and lands of Yester through his wife. The barony has stayed with the Hay family ever since.\nJohn Hay of Yester was in 1487 created a Lord of Parliament, as the first Lord Hay of Yester. In 1513 during the disastrous Battle of Flodden, John, second Lord Hay, was killed along with a great proportion of the country's fighting men. In May 1544 during the conflict known as the Rough Wooing, the castle, village, and harvest were burnt by the English army returning from the burning of Edinburgh.[5]\nJohn, 4th Lord Hay defended the castle from an English force in 1547, and was captured later that year at the Battle of Pinkie and held in the Tower of London for three years. In February 1548 the English commander Grey of Wilton captured the castle and put George Douglas of Pittendreich in charge of Yester and Dalkeith. French soldiers taken at Yester were used at hostages by the English.[6] According to Ulpian Fulwell, the captured garrison was mostly Scottish or Spanish. Two men suspected of shouting insults defaming Edward VI were made to fight a duel at the market place of Haddington.[7]\n1557 saw the death of the 4th Lord Hay. His son William abandoned the castle and moved into a new tower house on the site of the present day mansion of Yester House. In 1646 the 8th Lord John Hay was created Marquess of Tweeddale. The castle gradually fell into disrepair, and by the late 17th century was in a very parlous state, the stones having been much quarried for building material. Although the castle almost disappeared completely, Sir Hugo's original Goblin Ha' was tenanted by the Marquess' falconer until 1737. Yester House with its Adam interiors was sold in 1972 to Italian/American operatic composer Gian-Carlo Menotti then left to his son, Chip, who sold it in 2013.\nGoblin Ha' vaulting\nThe Wizard of Yester\nSir Hugo de Giffard was known as the \"Wizard of Yester\", and was considered to be a powerful warlock and necromancer. It is in the undercroft of the castle that he was thought to practise his sorcery. The 15th-century chronicler Walter Bower mentions the large cavern in Yester Castle, thought locally to have been formed by magical artifice:\n\"The death occurred of Hugh Gifford, lord of Yester. Old tales tell that his castle, or at least his cellar and keep, were wrought by witchcraft, for there is there a marvellous underground cavern wonderfully constructed and extending under a large area of ground. It is popularly called Bo' Hall.\"[8]\nLegend supposed that Hugo was able, via a pact with the Devil, to raise a magical army to his aid, and use them to carry out his will. It is this army of hobgoblins that was considered the builders of Yester Castle.\nThe Colstoun Pear\nWhen his daughter Margaret was to marry, Sir Hugo gave her and her husband-to-be, Broun of Colstoun, a hand-picked pear with the proviso that should anything happen to this fruit it would spell disaster for the Broun family. The pear was encased in a silver box and kept safe; the Brouns prospered.\nA few hundred years later however, in 1692, on her wedding night, the fiancée of Sir George Broun, a Baronet of Nova Scotia and inheritor of the Colstoun estate, decided to remove the pear from its casket. The fruit looked as good as when it was picked[citation needed], and she could not resist taking a bite. Misfortune quickly followed. Sir George Broun amassed enormous gambling debts and was forced to sell the estate to his brother Robert. Robert with his two sons were soon after killed, en route to Edinburgh; they were swept away by a flash flood caused by the River Tyne bursting its banks. In destitution, Sir George died in 1718 without a male heir. It was said that after the pear was tasted it turned as hard as rock, and with its bitemark in evidence, it is still at Colstoun House to this day.[9]\nLiterary references\nFor his supposed role in the struggles between King Haakon of Norway and King Alexander, ultimately culminating in the Battle of Largs, Sir Walter Scott immortalises Giffard in Marmion:\nA Clerk could tell what years have flown\nSince Alexander fill’d our throne,\n(Third monarch of that warlike name,)\nAnd eke the time when here he came\nTo seek Sir Hugo, then our lord:\nA braver never drew a sword;\nA wiser never, at the hour\nOf midnight, spoke the word of power:\nThe same, whom ancient records call\nThe founder of the Goblin-Hall.\nMarmion, Canto III, Stanza XIX, lines 324–333.\nSee also\nList of castles in Scotland\nList of places in East Lothian\nReferences\nExternal links\nGenealogical site and Brief history of the Giffards\nA History of the Hays and Yester with impression of the Castle when intact\nGifford Online – village website Archived 5 January 2010 at the Wayback Machine\nColstoun House Website\nHaunted East Lothian: Yester Castle\nthe goblin ha hotel in gifford\n55°53′26.23″N 2°42′37.92″W / 55.8906194°N 2.7105333°W / 55.8906194; -2.7105333\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "name": "Barnbougle Castle",
    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnbougle_Castle",
    "text": "Tower house in Dalmeny, Scotland\nBarnbougle Castle is a historic tower house on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth, between Cramond and Queensferry, and within the parish of Dalmeny. It lies within the Earl of Rosebery's estate, just north-west of Dalmeny House. Although its history goes back to the 13th century, the present castle is the result of rebuilding in 1881 by the 5th Earl of Rosebery, who served as Prime Minister from 1894 to 1895.\nEtymology\nOlder forms of the name include Barnbughall, Barbogle, Parnbogalle, and Pronbugele. This comes from the British brinn bugel, meaning 'shepherd's hill', or bar an bugel, 'shepherd's hill top', or alternatively pren bugel, 'shepherd's tree'.[1][2] All these names likely refer to the high ground which rises immediately behind the shore, which overlooks the grazing around the mouth of the Cockle Burn.[3]\nHistory\nBarnbougle seen from the south-west\nThe first building at Barnbougle was a thirteenth-century tower house, constructed by the Mowbrays, a Norman family who were also lords of Dalmeny and Inverkeithing.[4] Sir John Mowbray of Barnbougle, Laird of Dalmeny, was knighted by Sir Thomas Erskine at the battle of Homildon Hill in 1402.[5]\nThe laird of Barnbougle in 1586, John Mowbray, was a supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots, his wife was a sister of William Kirkcaldy of Grange and two of their daughters served Mary in England. Gillis was betrothed to her apothecary, and Barbara married Gilbert Curll, the queen's secretary.[6] It is thought that Mary gave Gillis Mowbray the jewellery now known as the \"Penicuik Jewels\".[7]\nThe Links of Barnbougle was the scene of a judicial combat on 15 March 1597. James Carmichael had killed Stephen Bruntfield, Captain of Tantallon, in a duel on 22 December 1596. He was made to fight Adam Bruntfield in single combat at Barnbougle.[8] The judges were the Duke of Lennox, the Laird of Buccleuch, and Sir James Sandilands. They wore lightweight clothes of satin and taffeta, one in blue, and one in red. Bruntfield killed Carmichael, according to some accounts in front of 5,000 spectators.[9]\nIn 1615 the Mowbrays sold Barnbougle to Sir Thomas Hamilton, afterwards Earl of Haddington. It was sold again in 1662, by Sir Thomas' grandson, to Sir Archibald Primrose of Carrington, a senior judge who became Lord Justice General of Scotland in 1676. Sir Archibald's eldest son by his second marriage, also Archibald Primrose, was created Earl of Rosebery in 1703, and Barnbougle became the family seat. At some point during the 17th century, the original tower house was rebuilt or replaced.[10]\nIn 1774, a plan for rebuilding the castle was drawn up by the architect Robert Adam. This proposal was for a triangular building, with the original tower at its seaward corner, but it was never executed. By the early 19th century, the castle had become dilapidated, and a wave supposedly washed into the dining room during supper.[4] The 4th Earl of Rosebery had Dalmeny House constructed on the estate, and the family moved in on completion in 1817. Barnbougle was used to store explosives, and after being damaged in an accidental explosion, it was subsequently left as a ruin.[4]\nIn 1881 the castle was entirely reconstructed and extended according to plans by James Maitland Wardrop, of Wardrop & Reid, in the Scots Baronial style. The older fabric of the north side was incorporated into the new building.[10] It was primarily built to house the private library of Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery (1847–1929), who became Prime Minister in 1894.[11] The collection specialised in Napoleonic as Rosebery was the author of Napoleon: The Last Phase.[12] Lord Rosebery practised his speeches here, in a purpose-built gallery hall.[13] Barnbougle remains a part of the Dalmeny Estate, and is still the property of the Rosebery family. It is a category A listed building.[4]\nDescription\nThe castle is built on a projecting rock terrace. It incorporates some of the fabric of the original castle on the north and east sides, but is mainly a late-nineteenth-century construction.[10] There are three storeys and an attic; the building is rubble, dressed in ashlar sandstone. Features include crow-stepped gables, bartizans (small turrets) with water spouts on the two western corners and a crenellated parapet. A panel on the east wall is inscribed \"Remove Not The Ancient Landmark Which Thy Fathers Have Set. Proverbs XXII.28\".[4] A 2.4-metre (7 ft 10 in) high obelisk sundial stands in the castle garden, having been moved there in 1890.[14]\nTraditions\nThe antiquary William Wallace Fyfe recorded, in 1851, a legend associated with Barnbougle and nearby Hound Point. He relates that \"whenever the death of any of its [Barnbougle's] lords is about to occur, the unwonted apparition of a black man, accompanied by a hound, appears upon the point, and winds from his bugle the death note of the baron. Hence the origin of the ancient name of Bar'n-bugle.\"[15] Fyfe took the story as inspiration for a poem relating the adventures of \"Sir Roger Mowbray\" and his faithful dog on Crusade in the Holy Land, culminating in Sir Roger's death and closing with the words:\nAnd ever when Barnbougle's lords\nAre parting this scene below\nCome hound and ghost to this haunted coast\nWith death notes winding slow.\nA number of variations on this legend have been recorded, including versions where the baying of a hound, rather than a trumpet, precedes a death.[16]\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Barnbougle Castle.\nRosebery Venues web site\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Historic castle in Edinburgh, Scotland\nFor other uses, see Edinburgh Castle (disambiguation).\nEdinburgh Castle is a historic castle in Edinburgh, Scotland. It stands on Castle Rock, which has been occupied by humans since at least the Iron Age. There has been a royal castle on the rock since the reign of Malcolm III in the 11th century, and the castle continued to be a royal residence until 1633. From the 15th century, the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as a military garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half.\nEdinburgh Castle has played a prominent role in Scottish history, and has served variously as a royal residence, an arsenal, a treasury, a national archive, a mint, a prison, a military fortress, and the home of the Honours of Scotland – the Scottish regalia. As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, the castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745. Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1,100-year history, giving it a claim to having been \"the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world\".[4] Few of the present buildings pre-date the Lang Siege of 1573, when the medieval defences were largely destroyed by artillery bombardment. The most notable exceptions are St Margaret's Chapel from the early 12th century, which is regarded as the oldest building in Edinburgh,[5] the Royal Palace, and the early 16th-century Great Hall. The castle is the site of the Scottish National War Memorial and the National War Museum. The British Army is still responsible for some parts of the castle, although its presence is now largely ceremonial and administrative. The castle is the regimental headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and houses their regimental museums, along with that of the Royal Scots.\nThe castle, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland, is Scotland's most (and the United Kingdom's second most) visited paid tourist attraction, with over 2.2 million visitors in 2019[6] and over 70 percent of leisure visitors to Edinburgh visiting the castle.[7] As the backdrop to the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo during the annual Edinburgh Festival, the castle has become a recognisable symbol of Edinburgh in particular and of Scotland as a whole.\nHistory\nPre-history of the Castle Rock\nGeology\nMain article: Castle Rock, Edinburgh\nDiagram of a crag and tail feature, such as the Castle Rock: A is the crag formed from the volcanic plug, B is the tail of softer rock, and C shows the direction of ice movement. In the case of Edinburgh, the castle stands on the crag (A) with the Royal Mile extending along the tail (B)\nThe castle stands upon the plug of an extinct volcano, which is estimated to have risen about 350 million years ago during the lower Carboniferous period. The Castle Rock is the remains of a volcanic pipe, which cut through the surrounding sedimentary rock before cooling to form very hard dolerite, a type of basalt. Subsequent glacial erosion was resisted by the dolerite, which protected the softer rock to the east, leaving a crag and tail formation.[8]\nThe summit of the Castle Rock is 130 metres (430 ft) above sea level, with rocky cliffs to the south, west, and north, rising to a height of 80 metres (260 ft) above the surrounding landscape.[9] This means that the only readily accessible route to the castle lies to the east, where the ridge slopes more gently. The defensive advantage of such a site is self-evident, but the geology of the rock also presents difficulties, since basalt is extremely impermeable. Providing water to the Upper Ward of the castle was problematic, and despite the sinking of a 34-metre (112 ft) deep well, the water supply often ran out during drought or siege,[10] including during the Lang Siege in 1573.[11]\nEarliest habitation\nSee also: Prehistoric Scotland and Castle of Maidens\nThe castle is built on a volcanic rock, as seen here in a 19th-century view from the Grassmarket area\nan Archaeological investigation has yet to establish when the Castle Rock was first used for human habitation. There is no record of any Roman interest in the location during General Agricola's invasion of northern Britain near the end of the 1st century AD. Ptolemy's map of the 2nd century AD[12] shows a settlement in the territory of the Votadini named \"Alauna\", meaning \"rock place\", making this possibly the earliest known name for the Castle Rock.[13] This could, however, refer to another of the tribe's hill forts in the area. The Orygynale Cronykil of Andrew of Wyntoun (c. 1350 – c. 1423), an early source for Scottish history, names \"Ebrawce\" (Ebraucus), a legendary King of the Britons, as having \"byggyd [built] Edynburgh\".[14] According to the earlier chronicler, Geoffrey of Monmouth (c. 1100 – c. 1155), Ebraucus had fifty children by his twenty wives, and was the founder of \"Kaerebrauc\" (York), \"Alclud\" (Dumbarton) and the \"Maidens' Castle\".[15] The 16th-century English writer John Stow (c. 1525 – 1605), credited Ebraucus with building \"the Castell of Maidens called Edenbrough\" in 989 BC.[16] The name \"Maidens' Castle\" (Latin: Castra or Castellum Puellarum) occurs frequently up until the 16th century.[17] It appears in charters of David I (r. 1124–1153) and his successors in the Kingdom of Scotland,[18] although the reason for it is not known. William Camden's survey of Britain, Britannia (1607), records that \"the Britans called [it] Castle Myned Agned [winged rock], the Scots, the Maidens Castle and the Virgins Castle, of certaine young maidens of the Picts roiall bloud who were kept there in old time\".[19] According to the 17th-century antiquarian Father Richard Hay, the \"maidens\" were a group of nuns, who were ejected from the castle and replaced by canons, considered \"fitter to live among soldiers\".[20] However, this story was considered \"apocryphal\" by the 19th-century antiquarian Daniel Wilson and has been ignored by historians since.[21] The name may have been derived from a \"Cult of the Nine Maidens\" type of legend. Arthurian legends suggest that the site once held a shrine to Morgain la Fee, one of nine sisters.[22] Later, St Monenna, said to be one of nine companions, reputedly invested a church at Edinburgh, as well as at Dumbarton and other places.[23] Similar names are shared by many other Iron Age hillforts and may have simply described a castle that had never been taken by force[24] or derived from an earlier Brittonic name like mag dun.[25][26]\nThe Castle seen from the North\nAn archaeological excavation in the early 1990s uncovered evidence of the site having been settled during the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age, potentially making Castle Rock the longest continuously occupied site in Scotland.[27] However, the extent of the finds was not particularly significant and insufficient to draw any certain conclusions about the precise nature or scale of this earliest known phase of occupation.[28]\nThe archaeological evidence is more reliable concerning the Iron Age. Traditionally, it had been supposed that the tribes of central Scotland had made little or no use of the Castle Rock. Excavations at nearby Dunsapie Hill, Duddingston, Inveresk and Traprain Law had revealed relatively large settlements and it was supposed that these sites had been chosen in preference to the Castle Rock. However, the excavation in the 1990s pointed to the probable existence of an enclosed hillfort on the rock, although only the fringes of the site were excavated. House fragments revealed were similar to Iron Age dwellings previously found in Northumbria.[29]\nThe 1990s dig revealed clear signs of habitation from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, consistent with Ptolemy's reference to \"Alauna\". Signs of occupation included some Roman material, including pottery, bronzes and brooches, implying a possible trading relationship between the Votadini and the Romans beginning with Agricola's northern campaign in AD 82, and continuing through to the establishment of the Antonine Wall around AD 140. The nature of the settlement in this period is inconclusive, but Driscoll and Yeoman suggest it may have been a broch, similar to the one at Edin's Hall near Duns in the Scottish Borders.[30]\nEarly Middle Ages\nMap of northern Britain showing the Gododdin and other tribes c.600 AD\nThe castle does not re-appear in contemporary historical records from the time of Ptolemy until around AD 600. Then, in the epic Welsh poem Y Gododdin there is a reference to Din Eidyn, \"the stronghold of Eidyn\". This has been generally assumed to refer to the Castle Rock.[31] The poem tells of the Gododdin King Mynyddog Mwynfawr,[32] and his band of warriors, who, after a year of feasting in their fortress, set out to do battle with the Angles at \"Catreath\" (possibly Catterick) in Yorkshire. Despite performing glorious deeds of valour and bravery, the poem relates that the Gododdin were massacred.[33]\nThe Irish annals record that in 638, after the events related in Y Gododdin, \"Etin\" was besieged by the Angles under Oswald of Northumbria, and the Gododdin were defeated.[34] The territory around Edinburgh then became part of the Kingdom of Northumbria, which was itself absorbed by England in the 10th century. Lothian became part of Scotland, during the reign of Indulf (r.954–962).[35]\nThe archaeological evidence for the period in question is based entirely on the analysis of middens (domestic refuse heaps), with no evidence of structures. Few conclusions can therefore be derived about the status of the settlement during this period, although the midden deposits show no clear break since Roman times.[36]\nHigh Middle Ages\nFurther information: Scotland in the High Middle Ages\nSt Margaret, depicted in a stained glass window in the chapel of Edinburgh Castle\nThe first documentary reference to a castle at Edinburgh is John of Fordun's account of the death of King Malcolm III (1031–1093). Fordun describes his widow, the future Saint Margaret, as residing at the \"Castle of Maidens\" when she is brought news of his death in November 1093. Fordun's account goes on to relate how Margaret died of grief within days, and how Malcolm's brother Donald Bane laid siege to the castle. However, Fordun's chronicle was not written until the later 14th century, and the near-contemporary account of the life of St Margaret by Bishop Turgot makes no mention of a castle.[37] During the reigns of Malcolm III and his sons, Edinburgh Castle became one of the most significant royal centres in Scotland.[38] Malcolm's son King Edgar died here in 1107.[39]\nMalcolm's youngest son, King David I (r.1124–1153), developed Edinburgh as a seat of royal power principally through his administrative reforms (termed by some modern scholars the Davidian Revolution).[40] Between 1139 and 1150, David held an assembly of nobles and churchmen, a precursor to the parliament of Scotland, at the castle.[38] Any buildings or defences would probably have been of timber,[41] although two stone buildings are documented as having existed in the 12th century. Of these, St. Margaret's Chapel remains at the summit of the rock. The second was a church, dedicated to St. Mary, which stood on the site of the Scottish National War Memorial.[41] Given that the southern part of the Upper Ward (where Crown Square is now sited) was not suited to be built upon until the construction of the vaults in the 15th century, it seems probable that any earlier buildings would have been located towards the northern part of the rock; that is around the area where St. Margaret's Chapel stands. This has been suggested that the chapel is the last remnant of a square, stone keep, which would have formed the bulk of the 12th-century fortification.[42] The structure may have been similar to the keep of Carlisle Castle, which David I began after 1135.[43]\nDavid's successor King Malcolm IV (r.1153–1165) reportedly stayed at Edinburgh more than at any other location.[39] But in 1174, King William \"the Lion\" (r.1165–1214) was captured by the English at the Battle of Alnwick. He was forced to sign the Treaty of Falaise to secure his release, in return for surrendering Edinburgh Castle, along with the castles of Berwick, Roxburgh and Stirling, to the English King, Henry II. The castle was occupied by the English for twelve years, until 1186, when it was returned to William as the dowry of his English bride, Ermengarde de Beaumont, who had been chosen for him by King Henry.[44] By the end of the 12th century, Edinburgh Castle was established as the main repository of Scotland's official state papers.[45]\nWars of Scottish Independence\nStatues of Robert the Bruce by Thomas Clapperton and William Wallace by Alexander Carrick were added to the Gatehouse entrance in 1929\nA century later, in 1286, on the death of King Alexander III, the throne of Scotland became vacant. Edward I of England was appointed to adjudicate the competing claims for the Scottish crown, but used the opportunity to attempt to establish himself as the feudal overlord of Scotland. During the negotiations, Edward stayed briefly at Edinburgh Castle and may have received homage there from the Scottish nobles.[46]\nIn March 1296, Edward I invaded Scotland, unleashing the First War of Scottish Independence. Edinburgh Castle soon came under English control, surrendering after a three-day-long bombardment.[47] Following the siege, Edward had many Scottish legal records and royal treasures moved from the castle to England.[46] A large garrison numbering 325 men was installed in 1300.[48] Edward also brought to Scotland his master builders of the Welsh castles, including Thomas de Houghton and Master Walter of Hereford, both of whom travelled from Wales to Edinburgh.[49] After the death of Edward I in 1307, however, England's control over Scotland weakened. On 14 March 1314, a surprise night attack by Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray recaptured the castle. John Barbour's narrative poem The Brus relates how a party of thirty hand-picked men was guided by one William Francis, a member of the garrison who knew of a route along the north face of the Castle Rock and a place where the wall might be scaled. Making the difficult ascent, Randolph's men scaled the wall, surprised the garrison and took control.[50] Robert the Bruce immediately ordered the slighting of the castle to prevent its re-occupation by the English.[51] Four months later, his army secured victory at the Battle of Bannockburn.[52][53]\nAfter Bruce's death in 1329, Edward III of England determined to renew the attempted subjugation of Scotland and supported the claim of Edward Balliol, son of the former King John Balliol, over that of Bruce's young son David II. Edward invaded in 1333, marking the start of the Second War of Scottish Independence, and the English forces reoccupied and refortified Edinburgh Castle in 1335,[54] holding it until 1341. This time, the Scottish assault was led by William Douglas, Lord of Liddesdale. Douglas's party disguised themselves as merchants from Leith bringing supplies to the garrison. Driving a cart into the entrance, they halted it there to prevent the gates from closing. A larger force hidden nearby rushed to join them and the castle was retaken.[44] The 100 English men of the garrison were all killed.[54]\nDavid's Tower and the 15th century\nThe 1357 Treaty of Berwick brought the Wars of Independence to a close. David II resumed his rule and set about rebuilding Edinburgh Castle which became his principal seat of government.[55] David's Tower was begun around 1367, and was incomplete when David died at the castle in 1371. It was completed by his successor, Robert II, in the 1370s. The tower stood on the site of the present Half Moon Battery connected by a section of curtain wall to the smaller Constable's Tower, a round tower built between 1375 and 1379 where the Portcullis Gate now stands.[44][56]\nA late-16th-century depiction of the castle, from Braun & Hogenberg's Civitates orbis terrarum, showing David's Tower at the centre\nIn the early 15th century, another English invasion, this time under Henry IV, reached Edinburgh Castle and began a siege, but eventually withdrew due to lack of supplies.[44] At least by 1436-7, Sir William Crichton was Keeper or Governor of Edinburgh Castle,[57] and soon after became Chancellor of Scotland. In an attempt to gain the regency of Scotland, Crichton sought to break the power of the Douglases, the principal noble family in the kingdom. The 16-year-old William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas, and his younger brother David were summoned to Edinburgh Castle in November 1440. After the so-called \"Black Dinner\" had taken place in David's Tower, both boys were summarily executed on trumped-up charges in the presence of the 10-year-old King James II (r.1437–1460). Douglas' supporters subsequently besieged the castle, inflicting damage.[58] Construction continued throughout this period, with the area now known as Crown Square being laid out over vaults in the 1430s. Royal apartments were built, forming the nucleus of the later palace block, and a Great Hall was in existence by 1458. In 1464, access to the castle was improved when the current approach road up the north-east side of the rock was created to allow easier movement of the royal artillery train in and out of the area now known as the Upper Ward.[56]\nIn 1479, Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, was imprisoned in David's Tower for plotting against his brother, King James III (r.1460–1488). He escaped by getting his guards drunk, and then lowering himself from a window on a rope.[58] The duke fled to France, then England, where he allied himself with King Edward IV. In 1482, Albany marched into Scotland with Richard, Duke of Gloucester (later King Richard III), and an English army. James III was trapped in the castle from 22 July to 29 September 1482 until he successfully negotiated a settlement.[58]\nEdinburgh Castle as it may have looked before the Lang Siege of 1571–73, with David's Tower and the Palace block, centre and left\nDuring the 15th century, the castle was increasingly used as an arsenal and armaments factory.[59] The first known purchase of a gun was in 1384, and the \"great bombard\" Mons Meg was delivered to Edinburgh in 1457.[60] The first recorded mention of an armoury for the manufacture of guns occurs in 1474, and by 1498 the master gunner Robert Borthwick was casting bronze guns at Edinburgh.[61] By 1511 Edinburgh was the principal foundry in Scotland, supplanting Stirling Castle, with Scottish and European smiths working under Borthwick, who by 1512 was appointed \"master melter of the king's guns\".[62] Their output included guns for the Scottish flagship, the \"Great Michael\", and the \"Seven Sisters\", a set of cannons captured by the English at Flodden in 1513.[63] Sir Thomas Howard, England's Lord Admiral, admired their graceful shape and brilliant finish, declaring them the most beautiful [cannon] for their size and length that he had ever seen.[64] From 1510 Dutch craftsmen were also producing hand culverins, an early firearm.[65] After Flodden, Borthwick continued his work, producing an unknown number of guns, but none have survived. He was succeeded by French smiths, who began manufacturing hagbuts (another type of firearm) in the 1550s,[66] and by 1541 the castle had a stock of 413.[67]\nMeanwhile, the royal family began to stay more frequently at the Abbey of Holyrood, about 1 mile (1.6 km) from the castle. Around the end of the fifteenth century, King James IV (r.1488–1513) built the Palace of Holyroodhouse, by the abbey, as his principal Edinburgh residence and the castle's role as a royal home subsequently declined.[58] James IV did, however, construct the Great Hall, which was completed in the early 16th century,[56] and the castle featured in his tournaments of the Wild Knight and the Black Lady.[68] His daughter Margaret Stewart was lodged in the castle with her servant Ellen More.[69]\n16th century and the Lang Siege\nSir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, who held the castle on behalf of Queen Mary during the Lang Siege of 1571–73. Painting by Jean Clouet\nJames IV was killed in battle at Flodden Field, on 9 September 1513. Expecting the English to press their advantage, the Scots hastily constructed a town wall around Edinburgh and augmented the castle's defences. Robert Borthwick and a Frenchman, Antoine d'Arces, were involved in designing new artillery defences and fortifications in 1514, though it appears from lack of evidence that little of the planned work was carried out.[70] Three years later, King James V (r.1513–1542), still only five years old, was brought to the castle for safety.[58] Upon his death 25 years later, the crown passed to his week-old daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots. English invasions followed, as King Henry VIII attempted to force a dynastic marriage on Scotland.[56] When the English burnt Edinburgh in May 1544 the gunner Andrew Mansioun firing from the castle destroyed an English cannon placed to bombard the forework.[71] In 1547 disaffected members of the garrison who resented Regent Arran came to Norham Castle and offered to let the English in.[72]\nRefortification in 1548 included an earthen angle-bastion, known as the Spur, of the type known as trace italienne, one of the earliest examples in Britain.[73] Brunstane Castle the home of the traitor Alexander Crichton was demolished to provide building materials.[74] The Spur may have been designed by Migliorino Ubaldini, an Italian engineer from the court of Henry II of France,[73] and was said to have the arms of France carved on it.[75] James V's widow, Mary of Guise, acted as regent from 1554 until her death at the castle in 1560.[58]\nThe following year, the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, returned from France to begin her reign, which was marred by crises and quarrels among the powerful Protestant Scottish nobility. In 1565, the Queen made an unpopular marriage with Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and the following year, in a small room of the Palace at Edinburgh Castle, she gave birth to their son James, who would later be King of both Scotland and England. Mary's reign was, however, brought to an abrupt end. Three months after the murder of Darnley at Kirk o' Field in 1567, she married James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, one of the chief murder suspects. A large proportion of the nobility rebelled, resulting ultimately in the imprisonment and forced abdication of Mary at Lochleven Castle. She escaped and fled to England, but some of the nobility remained faithful to her cause. Edinburgh Castle was initially handed by its captain, James Balfour, to the Regent Moray, who had forced Mary's abdication and now held power in the name of the infant King James VI. Shortly after the Battle of Langside, in May 1568, Moray appointed Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange Keeper of the Castle.[58]\nDetail from a contemporary drawing of Edinburgh Castle under siege in 1573, showing it surrounded by attacking batteries\nGrange was a trusted lieutenant of the Regent, but after Moray's murder in January 1570 his allegiance to the King's cause began to waver. Intermittent civil war continued between the supporters of the two monarchs, and in April 1571 Dumbarton Castle fell to \"the King's men\". Under the influence of William Maitland of Lethington, Mary's secretary, Grange changed sides, occupying the town and castle of Edinburgh for Queen Mary, and against the new regent, the Earl of Lennox.[76] The stand-off which followed was not resolved until two years later, and became known as the \"Lang Siege\", from the Scots word for \"long\". Hostilities began in May, with a month-long siege of the town, and a second short siege in October. Blockades and skirmishing continued meanwhile, and Grange continued to refortify the castle. The King's party appealed to Elizabeth I of England for assistance, as they lacked the artillery and money required to reduce the castle, and feared that Grange would receive aid from France and the Duke of Alba in the Spanish Netherlands.[77] Elizabeth sent ambassadors to negotiate, and in July 1572 a truce was agreed and the blockade lifted. The town was effectively surrendered to the King's party, with Grange confined to the castle.[78]\nThe truce expired on 1 January 1573, and Grange began bombarding the town. His supplies of powder and shot, however, were running low, and despite having 40 cannons available, there were only seven gunners in the garrison.[79] The King's forces, now with the Earl of Morton in charge as regent, were making headway with plans for a siege. Trenches were dug to surround the castle, and St Margaret's Well was poisoned.[80] By February, all Queen Mary's other supporters had surrendered to the Regent, but Grange resolved to resist despite water shortages within the castle. The garrison continued to bombard the town, killing a number of citizens. They also made sorties to set fires, burning 100 houses in the town and then firing on anyone attempting to put out the flames.[81]\nSir William Drury, commander of Elizabeth I of England's Protestant troops who brought the Lang Siege to an end in 1573. Unknown artist\nIn April, a force of around 1,000 English troops, led by Sir William Drury, arrived in Edinburgh. They were followed by 27 cannons from Berwick-upon-Tweed,[79] including one that had been cast within Edinburgh Castle and captured by the English at Flodden.[58] The English troops built an artillery emplacement on Castle Hill, immediately facing the east walls of the castle, and five others to the north, west and south. By 17 May these batteries were ready, and the bombardment began. Over the next 12 days, the gunners dispatched around 3,000 shots at the castle.[11] On 22 May, the south wall of David's Tower collapsed, and the next day the Constable's Tower also fell. The debris blocked the castle entrance, as well as the Fore Well, although this had already run dry.[11] On 26 May, the English attacked and captured the Spur, the outer fortification of the castle, which had been isolated by the collapse. The following day Grange emerged from the castle by a ladder after calling for a ceasefire to allow negotiations for a surrender to take place. When it was made clear that he would not be allowed to go free even if he ended the siege, Grange resolved to continue the resistance, but the garrison threatened to mutiny. He therefore arranged for Drury and his men to enter the castle on 28 May, preferring to surrender to the English rather than the Regent Morton.[82] Edinburgh Castle was handed over to George Douglas of Parkhead, the Regent's brother, and the garrison was allowed to go free.[83] In contrast, Kirkcaldy of Grange, his brother James and two jewellers, James Mossman and James Cokke, who had been minting coins in Mary's name inside the castle, were hanged at the Cross in Edinburgh on 3 August.[84]\nNova Scotia and Civil War\nMuch of the castle was subsequently rebuilt by Regent Morton, including the Spur, the new Half Moon Battery and the Portcullis Gate. Some of these works were supervised by William MacDowall, the master of work who fifteen years earlier had repaired David's Tower.[85] The Half Moon Battery, while impressive in size, is considered by historians to have been an ineffective and outdated artillery fortification.[86] This may have been due to a shortage of resources, although the battery's position obscuring the ancient David's Tower and enhancing the prominence of the palace block, has been seen as a significant decision.[87]\nThe battered palace block remained unused, particularly after James VI departed to become King of England in 1603.[88] James had repairs carried out in 1584, and in 1615–1616 more extensive repairs were carried out in preparation for his return visit to Scotland.[89] The mason William Wallace and master of works James Murray introduced an early Scottish example of the double-pile block.[90] The principal external features were the three, three-storey oriel windows on the east façade, facing the town and emphasising that this was a palace rather than just a place of defence.[91] During his visit in 1617, James held court in the refurbished palace block, but still preferred to sleep at Holyrood.[56]\nMemorial plaque to Sir William Alexander, on the Castle Esplanade\nIn 1621, King James granted Sir William Alexander the land in North America between New England and Newfoundland, as Nova Scotia (\"New Scotland\"). To promote the settlement and plantation of the new territory, the Baronetage of Nova Scotia was created in 1624. Under Scots law, baronets had to \"take sasine\" by symbolically receiving the earth and stone of the land of which they were baronet. To make this possible, since Nova Scotia was so distant, the King declared that sasine could be taken either in the new province or alternatively \"at the castle of Edinburgh as the most eminent and principal place of Scotland.\"[92]\nJames' successor, King Charles I, visited Edinburgh Castle only once, hosting a feast in the Great Hall and staying the night before his Scottish coronation in 1633. This was the last occasion that a reigning monarch resided in the castle.[58] In 1639, in response to Charles' attempts to impose Episcopacy on the Scottish Church, civil war broke out between the King's forces and the Presbyterian Covenanters. The Covenanters, led by Alexander Leslie, captured Edinburgh Castle after a short siege, although it was restored to Charles after the Peace of Berwick in June the same year. The peace was short-lived, however, and the following year the Covenanters took the castle again, this time after a three-month siege, during which the garrison ran out of supplies. The Spur was badly damaged and was demolished in the 1640s.[56] The Royalist commander James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose, was imprisoned here after his capture in 1650.[93]\nIn May 1650, the Covenanters signed the Treaty of Breda, allying themselves with the exiled Charles II against the English Parliamentarians, who had executed his father the previous year. In response to the Scots proclaiming Charles King, Oliver Cromwell launched an invasion of Scotland, defeating the Covenanter army at Dunbar in September. Edinburgh Castle was taken after a three-month siege, which caused further damage. The Governor of the Castle, Colonel Walter Dundas, surrendered to Cromwell despite having enough supplies to hold out, allegedly from a desire to change sides.[93]\nGarrison fortress: Jacobites and prisoners of war\nAn engraving of Edinburgh Castle made shortly before the creation of the Esplanade was begun in 1753\nAfter his Restoration in 1660, Charles II opted to maintain a full-time standing army based on Cromwell's New Model Army. From this time until 1923, a garrison was continuously maintained at the castle.[94] The medieval royal castle was transformed into a garrison fortress, but continued to see military and political action. The Marquis of Argyll was imprisoned here in 1661, when King Charles II settled old scores with his enemies following his return to the throne. Twenty years later, Argyll's son, the 9th Earl of Argyll, was also imprisoned in the castle for religious Nonconformism in the reign of King James VII. He escaped by disguising himself as his sister's footman, but was recaptured and returned to the castle after his failed rebellion to oust James from the throne in 1685.[93]\nJames VII was deposed and exiled by the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which installed William of Orange as King of England. Not long after, in early 1689, the Estates of Scotland, after convening to accept William formally as their new king, demanded that Duke of Gordon, Governor of the Castle, surrender the fortress. Gordon, who had been appointed by James VII as a fellow Catholic, refused. In March 1689, the castle was blockaded by 7,000 troops against a garrison of 160 men, further weakened by religious disputes. On 18 March, Viscount Dundee, intent on raising a rebellion in the Highlands, climbed up the western side of the Castle Rock to urge Gordon to hold the castle against the new King.[95] Gordon agreed, but during the ensuing siege he refused to fire upon the town, while the besiegers inflicted little damage on the castle. Despite Dundee's initial successes in the north, Gordon eventually surrendered on 14 June, due to dwindling supplies and having lost 70 men during the three-month siege.[96][97]\nEdinburgh Castle with the Nor Loch in foreground, around 1780, by Alexander Nasmyth\nThe castle was almost taken in the first Jacobite rising in support of James Stuart, the \"Old Pretender\", in 1715. On 8 September, just two days after the rising began, a party of around 100 Jacobite Highlanders, led by Lord Drummond, attempted to scale the walls with the assistance of members of the garrison. However, the rope ladder lowered by the castle sentries was too short, and the alarm was raised after a change of the watch. The Jacobites fled, while the deserters within the castle were hanged or flogged.[98] In 1728, General Wade reported that the castle's defences were decayed and inadequate,[93] and a major strengthening of the fortifications was carried out throughout the 1720s and 1730s. This was the period when most of the artillery defences and bastions on the north and west sides of the castle were built. These were designed by military engineer Captain John Romer, and built by the architect William Adam. They include the Argyle Battery, Mills Mount Battery, the Low Defences and the Western Defences.[99]\nThe last military action at the castle took place during the second Jacobite rising of 1745. The Jacobite army, under Charles Edward Stuart (\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\"), captured Edinburgh without a fight in September 1745, but the castle remained in the hands of its ageing Deputy Governor, General George Preston, who refused to surrender.[100] After their victory over the government army at Prestonpans on 21 September, the Jacobites attempted to blockade the castle. Preston's response was to bombard Jacobite positions within the town. After several buildings had been demolished and four people killed, Charles called off the blockade.[101][102] The Jacobites themselves had no heavy guns with which to respond, and by November they had marched into England, leaving Edinburgh to the castle garrison.[103]\nOver the next century, the castle vaults were used to hold prisoners of war during several conflicts, including the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the American War of Independence (1775–1783) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815).[104] During this time, several new buildings were erected within the castle, including powder magazines, stores, the Governor's House (1742),[105] and the New Barracks (1796–1799).[106]\n19th century to the present\nKing George IV waves from the battlements of the Half Moon Battery in 1822, drawn by James Skene\nA mass prison break in 1811, in which 49 prisoners of war escaped via a hole in the south wall, persuaded the authorities that the castle vaults were no longer suitable as a prison. This use ceased in 1814[107] and the castle began gradually to assume a different role as a national monument. In 1818, Sir Walter Scott was given permission to search the castle for the Crown of Scotland, believed lost after the union of Scotland and England in 1707. Breaking into a sealed room, now known as the Crown Room, and unlocking a chest within, he rediscovered the Honours of Scotland, which were then put on public display with an entry charge of one shilling.[108] In 1822, King George IV made a visit to Edinburgh, becoming the first reigning monarch to visit the castle since Charles II in 1651. In 1829, the cannon Mons Meg was returned from the Tower of London, where it had been taken as part of the process of disarming Scotland after \"the '45\", and the palace began to be opened up to visitors during the 1830s.[109] St Margaret's Chapel was \"rediscovered\" in 1845, having been used as a store for many years.[108] Works in the 1880s, funded by the Edinburgh publisher William Nelson and carried out by Hippolyte Blanc, saw the Argyle Tower built over the Portcullis Gate and the Great Hall restored after years of use as a barracks.[56] A new Gatehouse was built in 1888. During the 19th century, several schemes were put forward for rebuilding the whole castle as a Scottish baronial style château. Work began in 1858, but was soon abandoned, and only the hospital building was eventually remodelled in 1897.[56] Following the death of Prince Albert in 1861, the architect David Bryce put forward a proposal for a 50-metre (160 ft) keep as a memorial, but Queen Victoria objected and the scheme was not pursued.[110]\nSoldiers of the 92nd Regiment of Foot (later Gordon Highlanders) while on garrison duty at the castle in 1845.[111]\nEdinburgh Castle, waxed-paper negative by Thomas Keith, c. 1855. Department of Image Collections, National Gallery of Art Library, Washington DC\nIn 1905, responsibility for the castle was transferred from the War Office to the Office of Works,[112] although the garrison remained until 1923, when the troops moved to Redford Barracks in south-west Edinburgh. The castle was again used as a prison during the First World War, when \"Red Clydesider\" David Kirkwood was confined in the military prison block, and during the Second World War, when downed German Luftwaffe pilots were captured.[113] The position of Governor of Edinburgh Castle, vacant since 1876, was revived in 1935 as an honorary title for the General Officer Commanding in Scotland, the first holder being Lieutenant-General Sir Archibald Cameron of Lochiel.[114] The castle passed into the care of Historic Scotland when it was established in 1991, and was designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1993.[115] The buildings and structures of the castle are further protected by 24 separate listings, including 13 at category A, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland,[116] and special care was taken when installing 31 kW solar panels on the roof of the War Memorial, obscured by its parapet.[117] The Old and New Towns of Edinburgh, a World Heritage Site inscribed by UNESCO in 1995, is described as \"dominated by a medieval fortress\".[118]\nDescription\nThe Castle dominates the city skyline\nEdinburgh Castle is located at the top of the Royal Mile, at the west end of Edinburgh's Old Town. The volcanic Castle Rock offers a naturally defended position, with sheer cliffs to north and south, and a steep ascent from the west. The only easy approach is from the town to the east, and the castle's defences are situated accordingly, with a series of gates protecting the route to the summit of the Castle Rock.[119]\nPlan of Edinburgh Castle Key: A Esplanade · B Gatehouse · C Ticket office · D Portcullis Gate & Argyle Tower · E Argyle Battery · F Mills Mount Battery & One o'Clock Gun · G Cartsheds · H Western Defences · I Hospital · J Butts Battery · K Scottish National War Museum · L Governors House · M New Barracks · N Military Prison · O Royal Scots Museum · P Foog's Gate · Q Reservoirs · R Mons Meg · S Pet Cemetery · T St. Margaret's Chapel · U Half Moon Battery · V Crown Square · W Royal Palace · X Great Hall · Y Queen Anne Building · Z Scottish National War Memorial Outer defences\nIn front of the castle is a long sloping forecourt known as the Esplanade. Originally the Spur, a 16th-century hornwork, was located here. The present Esplanade was laid out as a parade ground in 1753, and extended in 1845.[56] It is upon this Esplanade that the Edinburgh Military Tattoo takes place annually. From the Esplanade the Half Moon Battery is prominent, with the Royal Palace to its left.[120]\nMain gate from the Esplanade into the castle (with the gatehouse)\nThe Gatehouse at the head of the Esplanade was built as an architecturally cosmetic addition to the castle in 1888.[121] Statues of Robert the Bruce by Thomas Clapperton and William Wallace by Alexander Carrick were added in 1929, and the Latin motto Nemo me impune lacessit is inscribed above the gate. The dry ditch in front of the entrance was completed in its present form in 1742.[122] Within the Gatehouse are offices, and to the north is the most recent addition to the castle; the ticket office, completed in 2008 to a design by Gareth Hoskins Architects.[123] The road, built by James III in 1464 for the transport of cannon, leads upward and around to the north of the Half Moon Battery and the Forewall Battery, to the Portcullis Gate. In 1990, an alternative access was opened by digging a tunnel from the north of the esplanade to the north-west part of the castle, separating visitor traffic from service traffic.[124]\nPortcullis Gate and Argyle Tower\nThe Portcullis Gate\nThe Portcullis Gate was begun by the Regent Morton after the Lang Siege of 1571–73 to replace the round Constable's Tower, which was destroyed in the siege.[125] In 1584 the upper parts of the Gatehouse were completed by William Schaw,[126] and these were further modified in 1750.[127] In 1886–1887 this plain building was replaced with a Scots Baronial tower, designed by the architect Hippolyte Blanc, although the original Portcullis Gate remains below. The new structure was named the Argyle Tower, from the fact that the 9th Earl of Argyll had been held here prior to his execution in 1685.[128] Described as \"restoration in an extreme form\",[128] the rebuilding of the Argyle Tower was the first in a series of works funded by the publisher William Nelson.[128]\nJust inside the gate is the Argyle Battery overlooking Princes Street, with Mills Mount Battery, the location of the One O'Clock Gun, to the west. Below these is the Low Defence, while at the base of the rock is the ruined Wellhouse Tower, built in 1362 to guard St. Margaret's Well.[129] This natural spring provided an important secondary source of water for the castle, the water being lifted up by a crane mounted on a platform known as the Crane Bastion.[130]\nMilitary buildings\nGovernor's House (1742)\nThe areas to the north and west of the Argyle Tower are largely occupied by military buildings erected after the castle became a major garrison in the early 18th century.[131] Adjacent to Mills Mount are the 18th-century cart sheds, now tea rooms.[122] The Governor's House to the south was built in 1742 as accommodation for the Governor, Storekeeper, and Master Gunner,[132] and was used until the post of Governor became vacant in the later 19th century; it was then used by nurses of the castle hospital. Today, it functions as an officers' mess, and as the office of the Governor since the restoration of the post in 1936.[133]\nThe New Barracks (1799)\nSouth of the Governor's House is the New Barracks, completed in 1799 to house 600 soldiers, and replacing the outdated accommodation in the Great Hall. They now house the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Scotland and the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys) as well as the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum. The latter was opened in 1995 by the regiment's Colonel, Queen Elizabeth II.[134] Also nearby, in the former Royal Scots drill hall, constructed in 1900, is the Regimental Museum of the Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment).[135] The military prison was built in 1842 as a detention block for the castle garrison and was extended in the 1880s. It was last used in 1923, when the garrison moved to the city's Redford Barracks.[109]\nNational War Museum of Scotland\nMain article: National War Museum\nWest of the Governor's House, a store for munitions was built in 1747–48 and later extended to form a courtyard, in which the main gunpowder magazine also stood.[136] In 1897 the area was remodelled as a military hospital, formerly housed in the Great Hall. The building to the south of this courtyard is now the National War Museum of Scotland, which forms part of the National Museums of Scotland. It was formerly known as the Scottish United Services Museum, and, prior to this, the Scottish Naval and Military Museum, when it was located in the Queen Anne Building.[137] It covers Scotland's military history over the past 400 years, and includes a wide range of military artefacts, such as uniforms, medals and weapons. The exhibits also illustrate the history and causes behind the many wars in which Scottish soldiers have been involved. Beside the museum is Butts Battery, named after the archery butts (targets) formerly placed here.[138] Below it are the Western Defences, where a postern, named the West Sally Port, gives access to the western slope of the rock.[139]\nUpper Ward\nFoog's Gate\nThe Upper Ward or Citadel occupies the highest part of the Castle Rock, and is entered via the late 17th-century Foog's Gate.[122] The origin of this name is unknown, although it was formerly known as the Foggy Gate, which may relate to the dense sea-fogs, known as haars, which commonly affect Edinburgh.[140] Adjacent to the gates are the large cisterns built to reduce the castle's dependency on well water and a former fire station, now used as a shop. The summit of the rock is occupied by St Margaret's Chapel and 15th-century siege gun Mons Meg. On a ledge below this area is a small 19th-century Dogs' Cemetery for the burial of the soldiers' regimental mascots. Besides this, the Lang Stair leads down to the Argyle Battery, past a section of a medieval bastion,[122] and gives access to the upper storey of the Argyle Tower. The eastern end of the Upper Ward is occupied by the Forewall and Half Moon Batteries, with Crown Square to the south.[120]\nSt. Margaret's Chapel\nSt. Margaret's Chapel\nMain article: St. Margaret's Chapel\nThe oldest building in the castle and in Edinburgh is the small St. Margaret's Chapel.[5] One of the few 12th-century structures surviving in any Scottish castle,[43] it dates from the reign of King David I (r.1124–1153), who built it as a private chapel for the royal family and dedicated it to his mother, Saint Margaret of Scotland, who died in the castle in 1093. It survived the slighting of 1314, when the castle's defences were destroyed on the orders of Robert the Bruce, and was used as a gunpowder store from the 16th century when the present roof was built. In 1845, it was \"discovered\" by the antiquary Daniel Wilson, while in use as part of the larger garrison chapel, and was restored in 1851–1852.[56] The chapel is still used for religious ceremonies, such as weddings.[141] Mons Meg\nMain article: Mons Meg\nThe siege gun Mons Meg, described in a 17th-century document as \"the great iron murderer called Muckle-Meg\" (muckle being Scots for 'big')\nThe 15th-century siege gun or bombard known as Mons Meg is displayed on a terrace in front of St. Margaret's Chapel. It was constructed in the Flanders on the orders of Philip III, Duke of Burgundy, in 1449, and given as a gift to King James II, the husband of his niece, in 1457.[60] The 13,000-pound (5.9 t) gun rests on a reconstructed carriage, the details of which were copied from an old stone relief that can be seen inside the tunnel of the Gatehouse at the castle entrance. Some of Meg's large gun stones, weighing around 330 pounds (150 kg) each,[142] are displayed alongside it. On 3 July 1558, it was fired in salute to celebrate the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the French dauphin, François II. The royal Treasurer's Accounts of the time record a payment to soldiers for retrieving one of her stones from Wardie Muir near the Firth of Forth, fully 2 miles (3 km) from the castle.[143] The gun has been defunct since its barrel burst while firing a salute to greet the Duke of Albany, the future King James VII and II, on his arrival in Edinburgh on 30 October 1681.[144]\nHalf Moon Battery and David's Tower\nHalf Moon Battery and Palace Block seen from the Esplanade\nThe Half Moon Battery, which remains a prominent feature on the east side of the castle, was built as part of the reconstruction works supervised by the Regent Morton, and was erected between 1573 and 1588.[122] The Forewall to the north was built between 1689 and 1695 to link the Half Moon to the Portcullis Tower, although part of the original wall of 1540 was incorporated into it.[122] The Half Moon Battery was built around and over the ruins of David's Tower, two storeys of which survive beneath, with windows facing out onto the interior wall of the battery. David's Tower was built on an L-plan, the main block being 51 by 38 feet (16 by 12 m), with a wing measuring 21 by 18 feet (6.4 by 5.5 m) to the west.[122] The entrance was via a pointed-arched doorway in the inner angle, although in the 16th century this was filled in to make the tower a solid rectangle. Prior to the Lang Siege, the tower was recorded as being 59 feet (18 m) high, and the remaining portions stand up to 49 feet (15 m) from the rock.[145]\nThe tower was rediscovered during routine maintenance work in 1912, and excavations below the Half Moon Battery revealed the extent of the surviving buildings. Several rooms are accessible to the public, although the lower parts are generally closed. Outside the tower, but within the battery, is a three-storey room, where large portions of the exterior wall of the tower are still visible, showing shattered masonry caused by the bombardment of 1573.[145] Beside the tower, a section of the former curtain wall was discovered, with a gun loop which overlooked High Street: a recess was made in the outer battery wall to reveal this gun loop. In 1912–1913 the adjacent Fore Well was cleared and surveyed and was found to be 110 feet (34 m) deep, mostly hewn through the rock below the castle.[145]\nCrown Square\nThe Royal Palace in Crown Square\nCrown Square, also known as Palace Yard, was laid out in the 15th century, during the reign of King James III, as the principal courtyard of the castle. The foundations were formed by the construction of a series of large stone vaults built onto the uneven Castle Rock in the 1430s. These vaults were used as a state prison until the 19th century, although more important prisoners were held in the main parts of the castle.[146] The square is formed by the Royal Palace to the east, the Great Hall to the south, the Queen Anne Building to the west, and the National War Memorial to the north.[147]\nRoyal Palace\nThe Royal Palace comprises the former royal apartments, which were the residence of the later Stewart monarchs. It was begun in the mid 15th century, during the reign of James IV,[148] and it originally communicated with David's Tower.[122] The building was extensively remodelled for the visit of James VI to the castle in 1617, when state apartments for the King and Queen were built.[149] On the ground floor is the Laich (low) Hall, now called the King's Dining Room, and a small room, known as the Birth Chamber or Mary Room, where James VI was born to Mary, Queen of Scots, on 19 June 1566. The commemorative painted ceiling and other decorations were added in 1617. On the first floor is the vaulted Crown Room, built in 1615 to house the Honours of Scotland: the crown, the sceptre and the sword of state.[150] The Stone of Scone, upon which the monarchs of Scotland were traditionally crowned, has been kept in the Crown Room since its return to Scotland in 1996. To the south of the palace is the Register House, built in the 1540s to accommodate state archives.[151]\nGreat Hall\nGreat Hall panoramic view-Edinburgh Castle\nThe Great Hall measures 29 by 12.5 metres (95 by 41 ft), and was the chief place of state assembly in the castle, although there is no evidence that the Parliament of Scotland ever met here, as is sometimes reported.[152] Historians have disagreed over its dating, although it is usually ascribed to the reign of King James IV, and is thought to have been completed in the early years of the 16th century.[153] The decorative carved stone corbels supporting the roof have Renaissance detailing, which has been compared to works at Blois, France, of around 1515, indicating that the arts in Scotland were relatively advanced at this time.[152] It is one of only two medieval halls in Scotland with an original hammerbeam roof.[154]\nFollowing Oliver Cromwell's seizure of the castle in 1650, the Great Hall was converted into a barracks for his troops; and in 1737 it was subdivided into three storeys to house 312 soldiers.[56] Following the construction of the New Barracks in the 1790s, it became a military hospital until 1897. It was then restored by Hippolyte Blanc in line with contemporary ideas of medieval architecture.[128] The Great Hall is still occasionally used for ceremonial occasions, and has been used as a venue on Hogmanay for BBC Scotland's Hogmanay Live programme. To the south of the hall is a section of curtain wall from the 14th century with a parapet of later date.[122]\nQueen Anne Building\nThe Queen Anne Building (centre-right)\nIn the 16th century, this area housed the kitchens serving the adjacent Great Hall, and was later the site of the Royal Gunhouse.[155] The present building was named after Queen Anne and was built during the attempted Jacobite invasion by the Old Pretender in 1708. It was designed by Captain Theodore Dury, military engineer for Scotland, who also designed Dury's Battery, named in his honour, on the south side of the castle in 1713.[156] The Queen Anne Building provided accommodation for Staff Officers, but after the departure of the Army it was remodelled in the 1920s as the Naval and Military Museum, to complement the newly opened Scottish National War Memorial.[122] The museum later moved to the former hospital in the western part of the castle, and the building now houses a function suite and an education centre.[157]\nScottish National War Memorial\nMain article: Scottish National War Memorial\nThe Scottish National War Memorial\nThe Scottish National War Memorial occupies a converted barrack block on the north side of Crown Square. It stands on the site of the medieval St. Mary's Church which was rebuilt in 1366, and was converted into an armoury in 1540. It was demolished in 1755, and the masonry reused to build a new North Barrack Block on the site.[158] Proposals for a Scottish National War Memorial were put forward in 1917, during the First World War, and the architect Sir Robert Lorimer was appointed in 1919. Construction began in 1923, and the memorial was formally opened on 14 July 1927 by the Prince of Wales.[159] The exterior is decorated with gargoyles and sculpture, while the interior contains monuments to individual regiments. The stained-glass windows are by Douglas Strachan.[160]\nThe memorial commemorates Scottish soldiers, and those serving with Scottish regiments, who died in the two world wars and in more recent conflicts. Upon the altar within the Shrine, placed upon the highest point of the Castle Rock, is a sealed casket containing Rolls of Honour which list over 147,000 names of those soldiers killed in the First World War. After the Second World War, another 50,000 names were inscribed on Rolls of Honour held within the Hall, and further names continue to be added there.[159][161] The memorial is maintained by a charitable trust.[162]\nPresent use\nPanoramic view from Edinburgh Castle, June 2024\nEdinburgh Castle is in the ownership of the Scottish Ministers as heads of the devolved Scottish Government. The castle is run and administered, for the most part, by Historic Environment Scotland, an executive agency of the Scottish Government, although the Army remains responsible for some areas, including the New Barracks block and the military museums. Both Historic Environment Scotland and the Army share use of the Guardroom immediately inside the castle entrance.[1]\nA re-enactor portraying James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, a husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, in the Great Hall\nTourist attraction\nHistoric Environment Scotland undertakes the dual tasks of operating the castle as a commercially viable tourist attraction, while simultaneously bearing responsibility for conservation of the site. Edinburgh Castle remains the most popular paid visitor attraction in Scotland, with over 2.2 million visitors in 2019.[6] Historic Environment Scotland maintains a number of facilities within the castle, including two cafés/restaurants, several shops, and numerous historical displays. An educational centre in the Queen Anne Building runs events for schools and educational groups, and employs re-enactors in costume and with period weaponry.[163]\nMilitary role\nSentries guarding the Gatehouse\nDirect administration of the castle by the War Office came to an end in 1905, and in 1923 the Army formally moved to the city's new Redford Barracks. Nevertheless, the castle continues to have a strong connection with the Army, and is one of the few ancient castles in Britain that still has a military garrison, albeit for largely ceremonial and administrative purposes. Public duties performed by the garrison include guarding the Honours of Scotland, and armed sentries stand watch at the Gatehouse outside opening hours. The post of Governor of Edinburgh Castle is now a ceremonial post. The New Barracks contain both the Governor's House, which serves as the Officers' Mess, and the Regimental Headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The Army retains responsibility for these and for the Royal Scots Museum and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum.[1][164]\nMilitary tattoo\nMain article: Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo\nRoyal Marines emerging from Edinburgh Castle during the military tattoo in 2005\nA series of performances known as the Edinburgh Military Tattoo (since 2010 the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo) takes place on the Esplanade each year during August. The basis of each performance is a parade of the massed pipes and drums of the Scottish regiments, and since its inception in 1950 the tattoo has developed a complex format that includes a variety of performers invited from around the world, although still with a largely military focus. The climax of the evening is the lone piper on the castle battlements, playing a pibroch in memory of dead comrades-in-arms, followed by massed bands joining in a medley of traditional Scottish tunes. The tattoo attracts an annual audience of around 217,000 people, and is broadcast in some 30 countries to a television audience estimated at 100 million.[165][166]\nOne O'Clock Gun\nThe One O'Clock Gun being fired from Mill's Mount Battery\nThe One O'Clock Gun is a time signal, fired every day at precisely one p.m., excepting Sunday, Good Friday and Christmas Day. The 'Time Gun' was established in 1861 as a time signal for ships in the harbour of Leith and the Firth of Forth, 2 miles (3 km) away. It complemented the 'Time Ball', which was installed on the Nelson Monument in 1852, but was useless as a visual signal in foggy weather. Because sound travels relatively slowly (approximately 343 metres per second (770 mph)), a map was produced in 1861 to show the actual time when the sound of the gun would be heard at various locations across Edinburgh.[167]\nThe original gun was an 18-pound muzzle-loading cannon, which needed four men to load, and was fired from the Half Moon Battery. This was replaced in 1913 by a 32-pound breech-loader, and in May 1952 by a 25-pound Howitzer.[168] The present One O'Clock Gun is an L118 Light Gun, brought into service on 30 November 2001.[169]\nOn Sunday 2 April 1916, at an unknown time of day, the One O'Clock Gun was fired in vain at a German Zeppelin during an air raid, the gun's only known use in war.[170]\nThe gun is now fired from Mill's Mount Battery, on the north face of the castle, by the District Gunner from the 105th Regiment Royal Artillery. Although the gun is no longer required for its original purpose, the ceremony has become a popular tourist attraction. The longest-serving District Gunner, Staff Sergeant Thomas McKay MBE, nicknamed \"Tam the Gun\", fired the One O'Clock Gun from 1979 until his retirement in January 2005. McKay helped establish the One O'Clock Gun Association, which opened a small exhibition at Mill's Mount, and published a book entitled What Time Does Edinburgh's One O'clock Gun Fire?[171] In 2006 Sergeant Jamie Shannon, nicknamed \"Shannon the Cannon\", became the 29th District Gunner,[172] and in 2006 Bombardier Allison Jones became the first woman to fire the gun.[173]\nSymbol of Edinburgh\nAlfred Buckham's \"Aerial View of Edinburgh\", from about 1920.\nThe castle has become a recognisable symbol of Edinburgh, and of Scotland.[174] It appears, in stylised form, on the coats of arms of the City of Edinburgh Council and the University of Edinburgh. It also features on the badge of No. 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron which was based at RAF Turnhouse (now Edinburgh Airport) during Second World War.[175] Images of the castle are used as a logo by organisations including Edinburgh Rugby, the Edinburgh Evening News, Hibernian F.C. and the Edinburgh Marathon. It also appears on the \"Castle series\" of Royal Mail postage stamps, and has been represented on various issues of banknotes issued by Scottish clearing banks. In the 1960s the castle was illustrated on £5 notes issued by the National Commercial Bank of Scotland,[176] and since 1987 it has featured on the reverse of £1 notes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland.[177] Since 2009 the castle, as part of Edinburgh's World Heritage Site, has appeared on £10 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank.[178] The castle is a focal point for annual fireworks displays which mark Edinburgh's Hogmanay (new year) celebrations,[179] and the end of the Edinburgh Festival in the summer.[180]\nSee also\nBanknotes of Scotland (featured on design)\nList of governors of Edinburgh Castle\nList of castles in Scotland\nMilitary history of Scotland\nArmed forces in Scotland\nHistory of Edinburgh\nStone of Scone\nNotes\nBibliography\nAshmole, Myrtle (1981).

    "text": "Castle in Fife, Scotland, UK\nAberdour Castle is in the village of Easter Aberdour, Fife, Scotland. Parts of the castle date from around 1200, making Aberdour one of the two oldest datable standing castles in Scotland, along with Castle Sween in Argyll, which was built at around the same time.[1]\nThe earliest part of the castle was a modest hall house, on a site overlooking the Dour Burn. Over the next 400 years, the castle was successively expanded according to contemporary architectural ideas. The hall house became a tower house in the 15th century, and was extended twice in the 16th century. The final addition was made around 1635, with refined Renaissance details, and the whole was complemented by a walled garden to the east and terraced gardens to the south. The terraces, dating from the mid-16th century, form one of the oldest gardens in Scotland,[2] and offer extensive views across the Firth of Forth to Edinburgh.\nThe castle is largely the creation of the Douglas Earls of Morton, who held Aberdour from the 14th century. The earls used Aberdour as a second home until 1642, when their primary residence, Dalkeith House, was sold. A fire in the late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased nearby Aberdour House, and the medieval castle was allowed to fall into decay. Today, only the 17th-century wing remains roofed, while the tower has mostly collapsed. Aberdour Castle is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland, and is open to the public all year.\nHistory\nOrigins\nThe barony of Aberdour was acquired in 1126, by Sir Alan de Mortimer, on his marriage to Anicea, daughter of Sir John de Vipont.[3] Sir Alan built St Fillan's Church, which still stands, next to the castle, in around 1140, and his family probably built the original hall house in around 1200,[4] or possibly even earlier.[5] In 1216, another Alan de Mortimer is recorded granting land to the monks of Inchcolm Abbey.[4] There is no record of what happened to the de Mortimers, but in the early 14th century, King Robert the Bruce granted Aberdour to his kinsman, Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray (d. 1332). Moray's grandson granted the barony in turn to Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale (c. 1300–1353), in 1342.[4]\nIn 1351, Sir William Douglas gave the lands of Aberdour to his nephew, Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith, although he retained the castle for himself until his death two years later. The grant was confirmed by King David II in 1361.[6] In 1386 Aberdour and Dalkeith were combined to form a single barony, with the principal seat at Dalkeith, near Edinburgh, and Aberdour as a secondary residence.[6] James, fourth Lord Dalkeith, succeeded to the joint barony in 1456, and was created Earl of Morton in 1458, prior to his marriage to Joanna, the deaf-mute daughter of James I.[6] The newly created earl expanded the existing hall house, heightening and rebuilding the structure to suit his elevated status.[7] The second earl carried out extensions to Aberdour Castle around 1500, building a new stair tower and south block.[3]\n16th century\nJames Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, Regent of Scotland from 1572 to 1578\nIn 1538 James V summoned the 3rd Earl of Morton before the Privy Council, accusing him of non-payment of his feudal dues,[6] and in 1540 he banished the Earl to Inverness.[8] Morton reached Brechin, in Angus, where he signed a deed resigning his lands to his kinsman Robert Douglas of Lochleven.[8] Lochleven was compelled to resign the lands in turn to James V, although he was permitted to keep Aberdour Castle. After James V's death in late 1542, George Douglas of Pittendreich and the Earl of Arran assisted Morton in reclaiming his lands, including Aberdour. In return their sons were to marry two of Morton's three daughters. Pittendreich's son James (1525–1581) married the heiress, Elizabeth, and succeeded, in 1553, as 4th Earl of Morton.[8]\nAberdour Castle was reserved to his mother-in-law, Katherine Stewart, dowager Countess of Morton, until 1564. Morton went to law in 1553 against Katherine Stewart, dowager Countess of Morton, over the lands of Aberdour. She had tried to hold a tenantry court at Aberdour, and Morton objected on the grounds that women who held lands in \"conjunct-fee\" had never held courts.[9] In 1564 Mary, Queen of Scots, confirmed Morton's right to the whole barony of Dalkeith and Aberdour.[10] In 1566, Morton was involved in planning a rebellion against the Queen, which resulted in the murder of Queen Mary's secretary, David Riccio, but failed to gain further momentum, and Morton was forced to flee to England.[11] However, by the end of the year he had returned, and by July the following year, Mary was imprisoned and had been forced to abdicate by the Scottish noblemen.[10] Morton was appointed Regent of Scotland, for the child King James VI in 1572.[10]\nMorton undertook extensions to the castle in the 1570s, rebuilding the south block of c. 1500, and extending it further south to form the present central range.[3] He also drew inspiration from contemporary gardens in England, such as Hampton Court, in laying out the terraced gardens.[7] The Privy Council met at Aberdour Castle in August 1576, but Morton's regency came to an end in 1578.[12] He was later implicated in the 1567 murder of Queen Mary's husband, Lord Darnley, and executed in 1581 on the orders of the young King.[12]\nWhile Morton was in prison, his lands were given to his nephew, Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus, but were granted to the Earl of Lennox after Morton's execution. In 1587, Lennox returned the Morton lands to Angus,[13] who was now acknowledged as the 5th Earl of Morton. On Angus' death, in 1588, the earldom of Morton passed to another kinsman, William Douglas of Lochleven (d. 1606). William's son predeceased his father, but his widow, Jean Lyon, continued to live at Aberdour with her third husband, Lord Spynie.[13] James VI and Anne of Denmark stayed for five days with Lord Spynie in December 1590.[14] Colonel William Stewart and Sir James Sandilands accused Spynie of entertaining the rebel Earl of Bothwell at Aberdour in 1592 but he denied this.[15]\nThe 17th century wing of the castle, showing the sundial\nThe later Earls\nWilliam Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton (1582–1648), sometimes numbered as the 6th Earl, inherited Aberdour from his grandfather in 1606. He was Treasurer of Scotland from 1630 to 1636, and a strong supporter of the Stewart dynasty during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639–1651). However, he was compelled to spend much of his fortune in the royal interest, leading him into financial difficulty, and forcing him to sell Dalkeith to the Earl of Buccleuch in 1642.[13] Earl William built the Renaissance east wing at Aberdour, probably around 1635.[3] It was certainly standing in 1647, when an inventory records luxurious furniture, carpets, and tapestries.[7] The walled garden was also built in the 1630s, and improvements made to the terraces.[7] Aberdour was therefore a suitable principal residence for the Earls after the sale of Dalkeith.\nThe Earls of Morton continued to live at Aberdour, although they never regained their earlier high status. In 1688 the castle was badly damaged by fire, and in 1690 the 11th Earl consulted the architect James Smith. Smith surveyed the damage and drew up proposals for repairing and extending the castle with another wing north of the east range.[16] The Earl also sought estimates for the demolition of the tower house and central range.[16] Nothing ever came of these proposals, although repairs were carried out to the east range, being completed in 1703.[16]\nFinal decline\nAberdour Castle ruins, 2010\nGovernment troops were stationed at Aberdour Castle during the Jacobite Rising of 1715. During their stay, a second fire again caused extensive damage. In 1725, the Mortons bought an adjacent property, Cuttlehill House, which they renamed Aberdour House, and the castle ceased to be a residence.[16] The east range was again repaired, and was used for various purposes, including a school room, a barracks, and a masonic hall.[16] In 1924 the castle and gardens were placed in state care, and continue to be managed by Historic Environment Scotland as a visitor attraction. The south-east wing was initially restored as a home for the custodian, and now houses a cafe. The castle is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument,[17] and the grounds, and surrounding former parks, are listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national register of significant gardens.[2]\nDescription\nGround-floor plan of the castle\nThe castle originally comprised the 12th- or 13th-century hall house, which was extended in the 15th century. In the 16th century the central range was built to the south of the tower house, and new inner and outer courtyard walls were constructed.[3] The east part of the inner courtyard wall is reduced to foundations, but the base of a round tower and a porter's lodge survive.[18] To the west, the inner courtyard wall remains, enclosing the former service courtyard, which comprises a brewery and bakehouse, with ovens.[19] The east range was added in the 17th century, along the south edge of the outer courtyard. The castle was originally approached from the north, with the entrance moved to the west, along with the 17th-century gate, when the Aberdour railway line was constructed in 1890.[3]\nThe tower house\nThe tower house measures 16 metres (52 ft) by 11 metres (36 ft) on a skewed rectangular plan.[20] The lower two storeys comprise the oldest part of the castle, which can be dated to around 1200, while the upper parts are of the 15th century. The date for the original building is based on several pieces of evidence. The cubical blocks of masonry, the flat buttress at the northeast, and the splaying, or widening, of the base of the walls, are all indicative of this date.[21] The collapsed part of the south wall also formerly contained an early 13th-century style double-lancet window.[3] The original structure, of a type known as a hall house, was probably of two or three storeys, comprising a first-floor hall over an unvaulted basement, and may have been surrounded by a defensive timber stockade or enclosure.[20]\nThe 15th-century rebuilding added two upper floors, and rearranged the interior. Vaulted basements, including a kitchen, and a spiral stair were inserted, and the heightened wall was topped by a parapet with machicolations; spaces through which objects could be dropped on attackers at the base of the wall.[3] The tower suffered major collapses in 1844 and 1919, and today just the basement survives, with only a small section of the southeast wall standing to its full height.[3]\nThe ruins of the tower house on the left, showing fallen masonry, with the central range behind\nThe central range\nThe central range was begun around 1500, possibly as a two-storey building containing a great hall, although only fragments of this building remain.[19] The south entrance to the tower house was blocked up, and replaced with a ground floor entrance from the east. A new stair tower, with a broad spiral stair, was built at the southeast corner. Originally topped by a conical roof, this stair gave access to the upper floors in the tower, and to the central range.[3] Around 1570, the 4th Earl of Morton rebuilt the block, extending it further south to form new apartments. This block, forming the present three-storey central range, includes a vaulted kitchen and cellar in the basement, with suites of rooms above.\nThe two bedrooms on the first floor each have their own closets and garderobes, or privies. The west apartment is accessed from the terraced garden, via another stair to the south-west, and has a private stair which led up to another chamber above, suggesting that these were the Earl and Countesses apartments.[3] The upper storey, whose timber floor is now missing, comprised three more apartments, including one over the stair. The exterior of the block is decorated with a horizontal decorative strip of masonry known as a string course. One first-floor window is decorated with carved stone pilasters and strapwork,[3] in a similar style to windows at Edinburgh Castle and Drochil Castle, in the Borders, both of which were built under Morton's Regency.[22]\nThe east range\nPainted ceiling in the east range\nThe east range, of c.1635, comprises a long, narrow building, with a short projecting wing to the southeast. It is the only part of the castle still roofed. The first floor of the wing is occupied by a long gallery, accessed from the central range, with stables and storerooms below. The long gallery was used for entertaining, and, in 1647, is recorded as containing 46 pictures and a harpsichord, among other furniture.[23] In the southeast wing are three chambers, one on each floor, linked by a spiral stair. The first-floor room has a 17th-century painted ceiling, decorated with fruit, foliage, and heraldic emblems.[3] The south-east wing has crow-step gables, and a sundial on one corner. The east window of the long gallery is decorated with pilasters and a pediment. The roof is of 18th-century date, and is lower than the original, resulting in the loss of the triangular pediments which once topped each of the side windows.[3]\nThe terraced garden, with the doocot on the right, and St Fillan's Church on the left\nThe gardens\nThere were gardens at Aberdour Castle from at least 1540.[24] The terraced garden dates from the time of the 4th Earl of Morton, who succeeded in 1553, and comprises four broad L-shaped terraces. At the bottom of the terraces was an orchard, laid out in 1690, and recently replanted.[24] The extent of the terracing was only rediscovered following excavations in the 1970s, after parts of the garden had been in use as a market garden.[2]\nArchaeological investigations were undertaken between 1977 and 1980, to determine whether the lower terraces, which were depicted on a map of 1740, had indeed existed. Although the foundations of the terraces were found, the remains could not be precisely dated, but are thought to have been constructed in the second half of the 16th century.[25] The high retaining walls were rebuilt in 1981,[3] and the terraces were laid with grass, since the excavations had not revealed any evidence of historic planting schemes.[25]\nAberdour Castle doocot\nA 16th-century \"beehive\" shape doocot, or pigeon house, is located to the south, containing around 600 nesting boxes. The 9 metres (30 ft) structure rises in four steps, divided by \"rat courses\"; projecting ribs which prevented rats from climbing inside.[26]\nThe 17th-century walled garden covers around 5,000 square metres (1.2 acres), with walls up to 4 metres (13 ft) high. It lies to the west of the outer courtyard, and was originally entered from doors in the southwest and northeast corners. These doors have carved pediments, with strapwork and the Douglas heart emblem over the west door, which led to the terraces. The east door led to St. Fillan's Church, and is carved with the date 1632, together with a monogram of the initials of the Earl and Countess.[24] A kitchen garden was located across the Kirk Lane, and bee boles are located in the walls. A summer house was built into the south-east garden wall in 1675, but was demolished in the 18th century.[2]\nIn 1691, botanist James Sutherland supplied exotic plants, including Persian jasmine, tamarisks and figs, to Aberdour from the Physic Garden in Edinburgh, the forerunner of the Royal Botanic Garden.[24] The later entrance in the west wall dates from around 1740. During the Second World War, the garden was in use as a market garden and for pig rearing.[27] In the centre of the garden, an early 17th-century polygonal sundial is mounted on a 19th-century base.[3] The sundial was brought here before 1887,[28] possibly from Castle Wigg in southwest Scotland.[27]\nAberdour House\nOriginally named Cuttlehill, the house was built in the 17th century, and is dated 1672.[29] It was enlarged in 1715 by its then owner, the Earl of Moray. The Earl of Morton purchased it in 1725, finally moving out of the dilapidated castle. In 1731 the 12th Earl consulted James Gibbs on improvements. It is uncertain how much of Gibbs' proposals were executed, although the doorway has a surround in Gibbs' style.[3] By the 20th century the house was disused, and was redeveloped as private flats in the 1990s. The house is Category A listed,[29] and formerly had its own extensive gardens, which included the surviving 12-metre (39 ft) high obelisk of 1744–45, built by the 13th Earl to be visible from his estate at Dalmahoy, across the Firth of Forth.[30]\nReferences\nBibliography\nApted, Michael (1996) Aberdour Castle.

    "text": "Castle in Fife, Scotland\nFalkland Palace, 'East Quarter' from the Courtyard\nFalkland Palace, 'South Quarter' from the Courtyard\nFalkland Palace, in Falkland, Fife, Scotland, is a royal palace of the Scottish kings. It was one of the favourite places of Mary, Queen of Scots, who took refuge there from political and religious turmoil of her times.\nToday it is under the stewardship of Ninian Stuart, who delegates most of his duties to the National Trust for Scotland. The Chapel Royal in the Palace is dedicated to Thomas the Apostle.[1] It is open to the public and reserved for Catholic worship.[2]\nHistory\nEarly years\nFalkland Palace from the gardens\nReal tennis court\nIn the late 12th century, a royal hunting lodge was located on this site. The lodge was expanded in the 13th century to operate as a castle, owned by the Earls of Fife of the noted Clan MacDuff. The castle was built here because the site is on a slight hill that could be defended. The surrounding land eventually were developed as the Palace gardens.\nTo the north, between the royal stable and the River Eden, was a great oak wood. Its many groves merged into the surrounding parkland. Timber was occasionally cut in the forest for royal ships of war.\nThe castle would have been surrounded by meadows, fields, orchards, glades and Falkland Park, which was a managed forest surrounded by a pale, a ditch with a fence on top of it. The pale would have been used to keep game inside the park reserved for hunting by the royal family and its courtiers. A park keeper maintained the Pale. In 1469 the keeper Bannatyne was docked wages for failing to keep it repaired.[3]\nIn 1371 Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Fife acknowledged Robert Stewart, Earl of Menteith, son of Robert II, as her heir. She made him keeper of the castle and forest of Falkland. In 1402 Stewart, by then Duke of Albany, imprisoned his nephew and rival David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, at Falkland; he was the eldest son of Robert III. The incarcerated Duke eventually died from neglect and starvation.[4]\nAlbany was exonerated from blame by the Parliament of Scotland, but suspicions of foul play persisted. These suspicions were carried against Rothesay's younger brother, the future King James I. These events eventually led to the downfall of the Albany Stewarts.\nAfter ordering the execution of Albany's son Murdoch in 1424, James I took possession of Falkland for the crown.[5] Falkland became a popular retreat with all the Stewart monarchs and queens consort. They practised falconry there and used the vast surrounding forests for hawking. Red deer and fallow deer were kept in the park for hunting, some brought from the Torwood Forest near Stirling.[6]\nMary of Guelders\nJames II of Scotland granted Falkland to his queen consort Mary of Guelders, and the palace or castle became a favourite residence.[7] The stables and other buildings in the close were repaired and a new kitchen was built for the visits of the royal couple in 1453. Linseed, cabbage seed, onion, leek, and other seeds were bought for the garden.[8]\nAs a widow, Mary of Guelders employed her stewards Henry Kinghorn and William Blair to supervise improvements at Falkland Palace in 1461–2. The works included a stairway from the queen's chamber to the pleasance, new stables, a coal shed, repairs and an extension to the counting house, and a smith-made andirons or firedogs for the queen's bedchamber and the fire grate of the great hall. The royal carpenter was Andrew Lesouris.[9] New structures included a \"galry\" with two chambers, apparently the earliest use of the French-derived term \"gallery\" in Britain.[10]\nWorks in the grounds included the construction of two ponds in the hay yard. A new lawn was laid near the queen's chamber, and a doorway was made for her to access the garden.[11] Such access was popular in this period; in other countries, Margaret of Anjou at Greenwich Palace and Isabella of Portugal at Bruges had access from their lodgings to the gardens.[12] Eleanor of Naples built new lodgings and a terrace garden at Castello Estense in Ferrara.[13]\nAt Linlithgow Palace, a door leads out to the garden and pele at the foot of what may have been the queen consort's tower under the oriel windows of the royal chambers.[14] Mary of Guelders is said to have had a garden walk made between two oak trees, known as \"Queen's Quarrels\", a name suggestive of the practice of archery, a \"quarrel\" being a name for a crossbow bolt. Another walk was called the \"Gilderland\".[15] The hay meadow of Falkland is regularly mentioned in the royal accounts, as are onions, because the palace gardener's pay was based on four barrels of onions.[16]\nJames III and Margaret of Denmark came to Falkland in September 1473.[17] The court of the Exchequer met at Falkland annually to complete the accounts of the jointure lands of James's mother, Mary of Guelders.[18] She may have intended to make Falkland Palace her residence and spiritual retreat in widowhood.[19]\nJames IV at Falkland\nBetween 1497 and 1541 James IV and James V transformed the old castle and royal lodgings into a beautiful renaissance-style royal palace. James enjoyed imported oranges at Falkland in April 1497 and gave a tip to the gardener and workmen building the dyke around the park.[20] In May 1501 James IV hired two stonemasons from Dundee to work at the palace, and an hourglass was bought for time-keeping. On 13 December 1501 he was entertained at Falkland by the female minstrel Quhissilgibboun, and in September 1504 by fiddlers, lutenists, and an African drummer known as the \"More taubronar\". A man from Pittenweem brought a live seal to the castle on 25 September 1502 and James IV gave him 14 shillings in reward.[21]\nA new chapel (perhaps on the site of the present south quarter) was roofed in 1512 by Alexander and John Slater, and masons worked on the garden wall. William Thome completed the walls of the great hall.[22] James IV was entertained at Falkland by the \"Wild Lady\", who received £10 for her appearances in 1513.[23]\nJames IV brought deer-nets from Kinneil House in November 1503. Andrew Matheson built a fold for deer in November 1505.[24] A trap was made to \"slay foxes in the park of Falkland\".[25] For a time in 1507 the horse of the French herald Montjoie, Gilbert Chauveau, was kept in the palace stables.[26] In May 1508 James IV and John Methven stalked deer in the park with a firearm called a culverin.[27] Later, wild boar, imported from France, were kept in the Park, within a fence made by the Laird of Fernie.[28] Dairy and beef cattle were kept to support the castle population.\nJames V and Mary of Guise\nThe teenage James V was detained at Falkland Palace by the Earl of Angus and, according to Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, escaped to Stirling Castle which was held by his mother Margaret Tudor. He had announced an early morning deer hunt in the park, but escaped by horse in the middle of the night dressed as a stable hand.[29]\nTo address the poor state of the garden and park, James V appointed a new Captain and Keeper, William Barclay, Master of Rhynd, in March 1527.[30] The Queen's Chamber was hung with tapestry for Margaret Tudor in September 1534.[31] James V extended his father's buildings in French renaissance style from 1537. He arranged to build a Royal Tennis Court and bowling alley in the garden in 1541.[32] The tennis court was called a caichpule in Scots and the game was known in French as jeu de paume.[33] Mary was said to have scandalised the people of Scotland by wearing men's breeches to play the game. The arms of the King of Scots at the gatehouse\nAmidst the building works and renovations, the Scotland court regularly went to Falkland, and in December 1538 and 1540 new velvet and satin gowns were packed in a canvas bag and sent to Falkland as gifts for the Queen's ladies in waiting.[34] In February 1539 one of Mary of Guise's French courtiers, Marie Pieris, married Lord Seton by handfasting. The French apothecary was also at Falkland on that day.[35] James V held a tournament at Falkland on or around May Day 1539.[36]\nMary of Guise spent time embroidering her husband's shirts at Falkland with gold thread in October 1539, and the luggage of her ladies in waiting included embroidery equipment, called \"broder warklumys\".[37] James V played cards with Mary of Guise during their visit in April 1540. While they were at the palace, servants washed the clothes of his infant daughter by Elizabeth Beaton, the Lady Jean Stewart.[38] Thomas Melville's wife kept the royal family's pets. In August Mary of Guise went riding at Falkland in a new cloak of scarlet cloth edged with crimson velvet.[39]\nThe goldsmith John Mosman made a gilt chalice for the couple's short-lived son Prince James, born 1540. In July 1541 they sent the chalice to Falkland to be used in the palace chapel. In the same month wild boar from France arrived. The Laird of Fernie built a new park dyke and a timber-fenced run for the boar.[40][41] The wild boar came from Elbeuf near Rouen, and Mary of Guise's younger brother René II de Lorraine, Marquis d'Elbeuf later became an enthusiast for the boar hunt with dogs and toiles, known as le vautrait.[42] James V kept a kind of menagerie at Falkland, employing Thomas Melville's wife to look after the pets.[43]\nAn inventory recorded a green velvet bed in the wardrobe at Falkland Palace with velvet covered posts, packed in coffers and travel bags called \"sowmes\".[44] Robert Murray, the plumber who maintained the fountain at Linlithgow Palace, provided lead work for a long vanished fountain at Falkland.[45]\nJames V died at Falkland Palace in December 1542, from an illness induced by the shock and grief of his army's defeat at Solway Moss. Some say he also grieved his wife's failure to give him a male heir, when she instead gave birth to the future Mary, Queen of Scots. His body lay in the Chapel Royal for almost a month and the chapel was draped in black. On 4 January 1543 messengers ordered the gentlemen of Fife to convey the king's body to North Queensferry on its way to Holyrood Abbey.[46]\nReign of Mary, Queen of Scots\nMary of Guise, mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, frequently stayed at Falkland.\nMary, Queen of Scots was born at Linlithgow Palace and moved to Stirling Castle in July 1543. Her mother, Mary of Guise, sometimes travelled without her to stay at Falkland Palace. Falkland and Stirling palaces were official residences of Mary of Guise as a widow, and she continued to keep wild boars for hunting in Falkland park.[47] Mary of Guise frequently stayed at Falkland, especially in autumn, and was recorded there in October 1546,[48] and in September 1549.[49] A letter, perhaps of 1548, mentions the refurbishment of the stables, the wardrobes, and the lodgings of one of her officials.[50]\nMary of Guise asked the Earl of Bothwell to escort her from Falkland to Stirling Castle for a convention or council in December 1549.[51] In October 1552, Regent Arran (who ruled Scotland on behalf of Mary) wondered if Mary of Guise would come from Falkland for a Privy Council meeting because the palace and town were too small for the number of expected attendees. He wrote, \"they will be a great company of folks and can not be easily lodged in Falkland\".[52] Regent Arran's daughter, Anne Hamilton, joined Mary of Guise at Falkland in June 1553.[53]\nNearby Myres Castle was the home of the Royal Macers and Sergeants at Arms who served Falkland Castle since at least the 16th century. John Scrimgeour of Myres supervised building at the Palace from 1532 to 1563.[54] He wrote to Mary of Guise about repairs to Falkland and its lead roofs, delayed by the frosts, and the carts he needed to bring stones to the palace and timber from the harbour at Levenmouth.[55] In May 1559 Scrimgeour repaired the stables and hired Adam Symmers to fix the palace windows. He also designed new ditches and fences for the garden.[56]\nMary, Queen of Scots, returned from France in September 1561, and hosted a group of diplomats at Falkland.[57] She held her Maundy Thursday or \"Skyris Thurisday\" ceremony at Falkland in March 1562, washing the feet of 19 young women. John Balfour bought new linen cloth for the aprons and towels which she gave to the maidens. The number of young women matched her age.[58] Mary came for Easter at Falkland in April 1563 and 1564.[59] The queen's many visits to Falkland have been tracked in archival sources.[60]\nJames VI and Anne of Denmark\nJames VI of Scotland was considered an adult ruler after October 1579. In preparation for his visits to Falkland, a cooper in Leith, William Todd, supplied barrels and brewing equipment for the palace.[61] In April 1582, James VI of Scotland made John Killoch and Robert Schaw keepers of all his tennis courts, and suppliers of his balls and rackets. In June 1583, Schaw spent £100 on refurbishing the court at Falkland.[62]\nJames VI spent the summer of 1583 at Falkland, and the English diplomat Robert Bowes noted it was a \"little house\" unsuitable for holding a parliament.[63] In 1584 James VI had the roofs repaired, and requested Agnes Leslie, Lady of Lochleven, and his tenants in Fife to send horses and help carry slates, tiles, timber, sand and lime to the palace. In July and August 1584, James welcomed Albert Fontenay, a French envoy sent by his mother, at Falkland, and lent him a horse to join in the hunting.[64]\nJames stayed in the palace during the plague in July 1585. For fear of infection, he ordered people with no business in Falkland or at court to stay away.[65] His guests in Fife in the summer of 1585 included the English ambassador Edward Wotton and three Danish envoys who came to discuss the Orkney and Shetland islands and the king's marriage.[66]\nIn August 1586, James VI was at Falkland with the French diplomat Charles de Prunelé, Baron d'Esneval.[67] In September he received a gift of books and hunting horses from Elizabeth I, and news of the discovery of the Babington Plot.[68] The Master of Gray wrote from Falkland to the Scottish ambassador in London that James was \"content for the law to go forward\", if her life was safe.[69]\nJames VI held a meeting at Falkland in September 1587 to discuss his marriage plans after hearing from his ambassadors that the elder Danish Princess Elizabeth was promised to another.[70]\nJames VI married the younger Princess Anne of Denmark; he included Falkland in the \"morning gift\" that he gave to his bride. On 12 May 1590 the Danish ambassadors rode from Wemyss Castle to Falkland to evaluate the palace and her Fife lands. They were welcomed by the keeper James Beaton of Creich.[71] The lawyer John Skene produced a charter of the queen's lands and, as a traditional symbol of ownership, the Danish Admiral Peder Munk was given a handful of earth and stone. After this ceremony, they rode to the Newhouse of Lochleven Castle.[72]\nThe following year, another Danish ambassador Paul Knibbe came to Falkland in July 1591. He brought a Danish gentlewoman, probably Margaret Vinstarr, to join the Queen's household.[73] Around this time an African servant of Anne of Denmark, known only as \"the Moir\" [Moor],[74][75] died and was buried at Falkland,[76] probably at the kirkyard of Kilgour. He was identified as a \"page of the equerry\" who wore clothes of orange velvet and Spanish taffeta.[77]\nRaid of Falkland\nFor five hours in the morning of 28 June 1592 Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, with the Master of Gray, James Lumsden of Airdrie, the Laird of Niddrie, John Colville, and Spott with others including men from Cumbria attempted to capture the palace and James VI and Anne of Denmark. James VI had been warned of Bothwell's approach and had stayed at Falkland rather than go to Perth as he had planned. Bothwell's plans had been revealed to the English ambassador in Edinburgh, Robert Bowes, and he had told Richard Cockburn, the Earl of Morton, and the Master of Glamis that the king should \"look narrowly about him\". Bothwell crossed the Forth at Queensferry on 27 June with 400 men.[78] The Earl of Erroll and Colonel William Houston were at Falkland and they were arrested on suspicion of being inside-men.[79]\nBothwell's men attempted to batter down the back gate but were repulsed by gunshots before midnight on 27 June.[80] The king withdrew to the gatehouse tower and his guard shot at Bothwell's men. According to James Melville the defenders who favoured Bothwell loaded their guns with paper rather than bullets. Bothwell abandoned the attack at 7 o'clock in the morning, and rode away with the king's horses.[81] James Sandilands gave chase. He captured nine men whose horses tired, five were hanged in Edinburgh's Canongate, the others were ransomed. One of John Colville's servants was hanged, a packet of coded letters and a cipher was found in his possession.[82]\nThe English border reiver Richie Graham of Brackenhill and his companions sacked the town of Falkland, taking horses, clothing, and money.[83] It was said that Bothwell had given a pep talk to his supporters, encouraging them to kill Sir John Carmichael, Sir George Home, and Roger Aston.[84]\nA month later it was said that Bothwell was advancing towards Falkland again from Stirling Bridge, and some of his men had landed in boats at a creek near Aberdour Castle. The king was forewarned by Harry Lindsay and prepared for another fight. The Earl of Argyll rode from his wedding party at Dalkeith Palace to help the king. Men in arms were summoned from Edinburgh, Haddington and Linlithgow to fight the rebel earl. However, Robert Bowes was told it was a deliberate false alarm, possibly intended to make the king move from Falkland to a less secure location. Bothwell also attempted to corner the King in Holyroodhouse.[85]\nPalace staff in the 1590s\nThe royal couple returned to Falkland in 1593, enjoying five tuns of wine which were shipped to nearby Levenmouth. At this time, James Beaton of Creich was keeper of the palace.[86] Robert Arnot of Kilquhus, Chamberlain of Fife, looked after the park and the meadow, and took receipt of local produce including the onions from the palace garden. Andrew Fairny maintained the dykes and ditches. The tenants of the village of Casch were compensated for damage done by escaped deer. James VI's master stabler David Murray kept the king's mares and stags in the park. Guilliam looked after the hay, and George Strathauchin was the palace gardener.[87]\nDeer from England\nQueen Elizabeth I sent deer for the park in 1586 and 1587, and again in 1591 from parks near Colchester. These were diplomatic gifts. In May 1586, James VI went to Falkland the deer taken out of carts and set loose in the park.[88] James asked the English ambassador Thomas Randolph for some of Elizabeth's huntsmen, Yeoman prickers and Grooms of the leash, and some horses.[89] A Yeoman pricker was employed to manage and guide the hunted deer.[90]\nEnglish huntsmen and bucks were sent to James VI in August 1586 by Randolph and the Scottish ambassador in London, Archibald Douglas.[91] Randolph wrote:I have sent the Kynge two hunting men, verie good and skillful, with one footman, that can hoop, hollow and crye, that all the trees in Fawkland will quake for fear. Pray the Kynge's Majestie to be mercifull to the poor bucks; but let him spare and look well to himself.[92]\nIn November 1586, Archibald Douglas wrote to Francis Walsingham that a gift of bucks from Elizabeth might help James with his grief at the forthcoming loss of his mother.[93] In May 1592 the English ambassador Robert Bowes went to Barnard Castle, Raby Castle and Brancepeth Castle with the English-born royal huntsman Cuthbert Rayne to catch deer for James VI and managed to catch only six, which he shipped from Sunderland to Kirkcaldy.[94] In April 1597, the carpenter and \"master wright\" James Murray was in charge of transporting 28 English deer from Leith to Falkland. Robin the Hunter kept hounds for James at Falkland. Anne of Denmark sent deer hounds as gifts to her brother, Christian IV of Denmark.[95]\nA royal quarrel\nJames VI and Anne of Denmark spent time at Falkland during their quarrel about Prince Henry\nAnother Danish commission including Steen Bille and Niels Krag visited in 1593, which resulted in the keeper James Beaton of Creich giving more rights over the lands and buildings to the queen, Anne of Denmark.[96] She came to stay on 12 July 1594 before the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle. It was said she left Edinburgh for Falkland because Holyrood Palace was not magnificent enough to receive the Danish ambassadors Steen Bille and Christian Barnekow.[97]\nJames VI arranged for Prince Henry to stay at Stirling Castle with the Earl of Mar. This did not suit the queen. Courtiers took sides as the quarrel deepened. In August 1595 James persuaded Anne, who was now reluctant to leave Edinburgh, to come to Falkland and meet the Earl of Mar for a reconciliation. The kirk minister and royal chaplain Patrick Galloway gave a sermon about Adam and Eve and the duties of man and wife to each other, and it was thought that \"she gave good ear to his advice\". Another church minister David Lindsay, had a \"long conference\" with Anne at Falkland, hoping to heal the quarrel. It was said that James were Anne were now \"being so lovingly together at Falkland\".[98]\nAnne was joined at Falkland by her friend and servant Margaret Vinstarr. She had returned from visiting the queen's mother, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, whose message to her daughter was that she ought to obey her husband's will in all things.[99]\nThe witch-hunt of 1597\nOn 12 August 1597, James VI and his Privy Council gathered at Falkland Palace during the Great Scottish Witch Hunt of 1597 to issue a general proclamation revoking some of the commissions of justiciary against suspected witches.[100] The proclamation came after the contentious commissions based on the evidence of accused witch, Margaret Aitken, who claimed she could detect other witches just by looking at their eyes.[101] With this proclamation, the Order of Council restored duties to James VI which had been delegated as general commissions in 1591, giving local landowners the power to execute accused witches without dispute from central government.[102]\nBy restoring these powers to the King, the Privy Council hoped to reduce the number of 'innocent' people killed.[102] However, the order was quite limited in reality, only discrediting commissions presided over by one or two men alone, and it also reiterated James VI's determination to continue with the witch-hunt.[103] However, during the trials of the early seventeenth century, the proclamation at Falkland Palace did help to introduce a new regime of restricted witch-hunting, and it demonstrated greater considerations surrounding the evidence needed to condemn a witch.[100][103]\nLast years as a royal palace\nWhen Anne of Denmark visited in September 1598 her bed chamber was hung with tapestry brought from Holyroodhouse. Rhenish, \"Rence\", wine was brought to Falkland for her.[104] A French ambassador Philippe de Béthune, brother of the Duke of Sully, came in July 1599. The English diplomat Sir William Bowes was reluctant to come to Falkland, where James VI might show more favour to the French ambassador. Béthune fell ill, needing a surgeon and a physician to bleed him. It was rumoured he had been poisoned. He recovered and went on a progress with the king to Inchmurrin and Hamilton Palace, after James VI wrote to the Laird of Wemyss for the loan of his best hackney horse and saddle.[105]\nIn July 1600 herons nested in the park, and James VI hoping to have them \"increase and multiply\" forbade anyone to kill herons in neighbouring lands.[106] In August a French acrobat danced on a tightrope in the palace courtyard for the king and the queen.[107]\nJames VI played cards with the English diplomat George Nicholson at Falkland in May 1602.[108] In September 1602 Anne of Denmark and the Master of Gray entertained Anne de Gondi, the wife of French ambassador the Baron de Tour, at Falkland, while he went on a progress with the king.[109] Lord Henry Howard noted that the Master of Gray had spent this time with Queen Anne and it affected the conceit of his writing style.[110]\nDavid Murray became keeper of the garden, park, and Lomond Hills and was allowed to build a house on the site of the old castle, called the Castlestead or Nether Palace of Falkland. Lord Walden stayed for a night in August 1613.[111] This house was inherited by the next keeper of the park, John Murray, 1st Earl of Annandale.[112] The palace was occasionally used as a prison.[113] In November 1608 James instructed David Murray to keep James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino, prisoner in the tower of the palace, for treasonable correspondence with the Pope. Balmerino was released in October 1609.[114] After hearing Anne of Denmark speak of her love of Scotland, the Venetian ambassador Antonio Foscarini came to Falkland in September 1613.[115]\nUnion of the Crowns\nAfter the Union of the Crowns in 1603, Andrew Murray of Balvaird kept a watchful eye on the palace and in 1615 he advised John Murray of the bedchamber that the king should send a commission for repairs, because otherwise \"it will not fail to fall all to the ground. The back galleries are already decayed\".[116] The architect James Murray repaired the palace for the visit of King James in 1617.[117] Some courtiers were lodged in the house of Nicol Moncrieff, which still stands in Falkland, opposite the palace gate.[118] At the celebrations to welcome the king on 19 May, David Wedderburn provided a Latin poem, in which the King, after a day of hunting, was asked to contemplate the memorials of Scotland's past, victories over the Romans and Vikings, the wars of Scottish Independence, and the present union of the kingdoms of Britain.[119]\nThe palace was repaired in 1629. Roofing slates were shipped from Dundee to Newburgh. A glazier, David Masterton, painted the iron window grills or yetts with red lead. A new set of wooden armorial panels were made for the gatehouse and painted by Valentine Jenkin.[120]\nCivil war\nCharles I, and Charles II also visited Falkland. Accounts survive for Charles II's stay in July 1650, when proclamations had to be made to reduce the inflated prices of lodgings and horse-hire charged in the village. Charles' food was seasoned with saffron, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Every tart provided for the king's table had a pound of sugar, while tarts for lesser courtiers required only half a pound.[121] The mining entrepreneur James Hope of Hopetoun visited on 18 July and met the king's physician Dr Fraser, and various officials. In the privy chamber, Charles thanked him for a previous gift of a piece of Scottish gold, and later they talked about mining and technology.[122]\nA fire partially destroyed the palace during its subsequent occupation by Oliver Cromwell's troops, and it quickly fell into ruin.\n19th century\nArms of the Marquess of Bute\nIn 1887 John, 3rd Marquis of Bute, purchased the estates of Falkland and started a 20-year restoration of the palace using two architects: John Kinross and Robert Weir Schultz. At the time the Palace was a ruin with no windows or doors. Thanks to his restoration work and considerable budget the Palace remains standing today. Many features in and around the Palace show evidence of his work, such as the \"B\" on the guttering and portraits of his children carved into a cupboard door in the Keeper's Dressing Room.\nDuring the time of Lord Bute, the ornamental kitchen garden was enhanced by a pergola and decorative vases. The north part of the \"upper garden\" was redesigned to express the foundations of Falkland Castle and Palace North Range which were uncovered during the Marquis's archaeological excavations. Walls were built atop the foundations for the Well Tower and the Great Hall to emphasise the structures.\nThe Orchard and Palace gardens were linked to the House of Falkland by the private walk and new bridges. Houses were built near the palace and connected into the ornamental kitchen garden and orchard by a system of new public and private paths. The ground around the curling pond (to the North East of the orchard) was planted with trees and shrubs and laid out in flower plots.\nThe enclosing yew hedge around the pond garden is a typical feature of period. The lime tree avenue which is north of the palace gatehouse was built sometime between 1894 and 1912–13 according to the Ordinance Surveys of those periods. The Victorian glass house was built in 1890 by Mckenzie and Moncur from Edinburgh for Lord Bute and was used mainly to grow flowers and exotic plants. Plant hunting was popular at that time and wealthy people would travel the world to find specimens, and plant in their gardens for display to friends. There is also evidence that there was a second glass house in the garden near the existing one.\nModern era\nA 1902 view of the palace\nIn 1952, the Hereditary Keeper Major Michael Crichton Stewart decided to appoint the National Trust for Scotland to take care of the Palace. The National Trust thus became Deputy Keeper of the Palace, and they now care for and maintain the Palace and its extensive gardens. The NTS website offers an array of articles and images exploring the Palace and grounds.[123]\nNational Galleries Scotland have created a digital project exploring how the palace would look if reimagined in a warmer setting due to climate change.[124]\nGardens\nFalkland Palace stands on three hectares of ground on a sandstone ridge which is dominated by the Lomond Hills in the background. Those walking around the garden will see a distinct and overlapping timeline which reveals the ever-changing purpose and style of the grounds.\nThe first record of a garden here was in 1451. In 1500, a new gardener, John Strathachin or Strachen, was to be paid 4 merks yearly with grazing for his horse and cows. He was to provide fruit, onions and herbs.[125] At that time the garden had a courtyard and stables in the gatehouse, where King James IV kept his great Belgian steed. There was also a fish pond which provided the King with fresh fish. Fruit, vegetables and herbs were grown in the area for the royal plate and meat could be hunted in the ancient forest (known as Falkland Forest) surrounding the Palace, by hawking and hunting wild boar and deer.\nJames VI met the English ambassadors Sir Robert Bowes and Sir William Bowes in the garden at 8 o'clock on 21 June 1597 and listened to their speeches about border affairs.[126] In August 1602 James VI received the French ambassador, the Baron de Tour, in the garden. They talked for three quarters of an hour and the ambassador made the king laugh. A few days later they hunted together in the park.[127]\nGarden designer Percy Cane redesigned the gardens in the 1940s. He had designed the palace grounds at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. Cane was born and educated in Essex where he studied horticulture and architecture. In 1930 Cane founded and edited the quarterly journal Garden Design and wrote many books on garden design. Cane's style can best be described as Arts and Crafts and his curvy borders were seen as innovatory at the time.\nConservation in the garden is achieved through general maintenance, which includes clearing leaves, mowing the main lawn, tidying the flower beds and planting, enhancing and creating wildlife habitats. A wildflower meadow, native hedges and spring flowering bulbs have been planted to provide food and protection to various small insects and small mammals. Conservation means work has to be carried out in a sympathetic way throughout property, not only to the aesthetics and history of the palace but also for the climbing plants and bats that live in the cellars. Bats are endangered and protected in Scotland and it is important that they are not disturbed. The walls of the palace have been repointed (replacing the cement between the stones) and replaced with lime mortar which is a traditional material and better suited for this purpose as it is breathable and prevents dampening.\nThe current Head Gardener Sonia Ferrás Mañá is restoring the Percy Cane garden to the original design and flower choice. Mañá, the garden staff and volunteers have been working on various project in recent years to conserve the garden and encourage wildlife.\nThe garden team at Falkland Palace are now encouraging wildlife by bringing back the meadow. To create the meadow the grass has been cut only once a year for the last four years and more than 10,000 wild flowers and a similar number of spring flowering bulbs have been planted. This work is thanks to the garden staff, volunteers and support from Fife Environmental Trust, Scottish Natural Heritage, NTS Member Centres and other donations. These flowers and un-mown grasses encourage beneficial insects to the orchard which aid in the fruit trees pollination and in turn attract other animals. There are currently forty different fly species in the orchard, some of which are rare or unusual and some are found nowhere else in Scotland. The insects, especially the moths, have attracted Pipistrelle and Soprano Pipistrelle bats which have been seen hunting and living here. There have also been sightings of red squirrels in the forest which are now considered endangered animals due to the disappearance of their habitat and the competition from grey squirrels. A Red Squirrel Project is carried out at Falkland Palace to encourage them back into the gardens. A shelter was built in the orchard for invertebrate (i.e. insects and worms) and small animals which will encourage them to stay longer in the garden and perhaps live there. The orchard has been planted with native trees such as hawthorn, oak and willows which would have been growing here in the 15th century. The Maspie Burn running between the garden and the orchard is a habitat for water wildlife, including trout.\nBuilding materials\nFalkland Palace, entrance façade\nChapel Royal inside the South Range of Falkland Palace\nSome sandstone for the palace was quarried locally. Limestone for lime mortar was found and burnt on the Lomond Hills. In 1540, harder sandstone was quarried at Kingoodie near Dundee and shipped across the Tay to the haven of Lindores Abbey. Much of the timber, including imported \"Eastland boards\", deals, and rafters supplied by a Danish merchant called \"Kinnereis\", was bought at St Andrews and Dundee, where it was bound together into rafts called \"floats\" and towed to Newburgh or Lindores and Levenmouth. Other timber was bought at Leith at Kirkcaldy.[128]\nDescription\nThe palace has two wings arranged in an 'L' shape, now called the South and East Quarters or Ranges. The palace courtyard is entered through the gatehouse tower at the west end of the South Quarter. The external ashlar façade of the South Quarter has gunloops at basement level. Above these are the small windows of the private lodgings, and on the second level the large paired windows of the Chapel Royal. Between these windows are weathered niches and statues. The corbels show the instruments of the passion; the chapel at Falkland was dedicated to St Thomas and is the Catholic parish church for Falkland with Mass every Sunday at 9 a.m.[129]\nThe wallhead is finished with a decorated cornice and battlement which continues around the west side of the gate tower. To the east of the chapel there is small rectangular sectioned tower which once housed a circular staircase, and beyond is the partly reconstructed gable of the East Quarter. Although some writers have attributed part of the South Quarter to the time of James IV, the form of the gunloops, the continuous parapet, and the documented payments to Peter the Flemishman for the 5 statues in 1539 adequately demonstrate that the present appearance dates from the works of James V.[130] The entrance tower was built in 1541, and the accounts record the work of two master masons: \"to John Brownhill and Henry Bawtie for complete ending of the fore entry and tower ... and raising of certain chimneys in the south quarter.\"[131] Within the gate tower and south quarter, visitors can view the Keeper's Apartments in the tower, the Chapel Royal and gallery.\nThe East Quarter, apart from its courtyard façade is ruined. The centrally placed access tower, the Crosshouse, was reconstructed by the Marquis of Bute. The National Trust's architect, Schomberg Scott recreated the King and Queen's bedchambers within. The northern section of the East Quarter was originally a lodging built by James IV. The East Quarter was remodelled by the mason John Merlioun in 1538.[132] This part of the building, with its \"back galleries\" overlooking the garden was decayed in 1615.[133] In 1616 the master of works, James Murray was ordered to repair the flat roof of the King and Queen's galleries and the roof of the lodging of the East Quarter in anticipation of the visit of James VI.[134]\nComparable façade at Villers-Cotterêts\nThe South and East courtyard façades were decorated and unified with pilasters in a French Renaissance style between 1537 and 1542. Their appearance is comparable to the French Chateau of Villers-Cotterêts. The buttresses on the East are dated 1537, and on the South, where the masonry is more sophisticated, 1539. The later work may be connected with the arrival of Nicolas Roy, a French mason sent to Scotland in March 1539 by Antoinette of Bourbon, the mother of Mary of Guise.[135]\nThe chapel ceiling dates from the time of James V, as recent dendrochronology work by the AOC Group has confirmed.[136] It was constructed by the carpenter Richard Stewart, and was re-decorated for the visit of Charles I in 1633. James Murray, master of works, was ordered to repair the roof of the South Quarter in 1625, with instructions to \"have a special care and regard\" that the great ceiling of the Chapel be \"preserved and kept as far as possibly may be.\"[137]\nThe tennis court, Cross House, and the east turnpike stair turret were plastered and harled for James V by John Kelly and John Malcolm alias Callum. Some of the interiors were plastered by a French specialist craftsman Hector Beato.[138]\nThe courtyard was originally completed on the north with a great hall to the north. The footprint of the building was established by excavation and laid out with paving slabs by the 3rd Marquis of Bute. Beyond this area are the reconstructed footings of Falkland Castle. This was the site of the short-lived Nether Palace or Castlestead in the 17th century, known from a plan and elevation drawn by Alexander Edward.\nReal tennis court\nOn the lower ground in the gardens, slightly beyond the remains of the medieval castle uncovered c. 1900, lies the original real tennis court. The masons William Mason and Alexander Allardice, and others built the tennis court. Its walls were finished by Callum the pargeoner, or lime plasterer.[139] It is the world's oldest tennis court still in use. The roofed spectator area is home to a number of swallows during spring and summer. The court is home to the Falkland Palace Royal Tennis Club.\nReferences\nFurther reading\nDunbar, John G. (1999).

    "text": "Castle outside Arncroach, Fife, Scotland\nNot to be confused with Kellie's Castle.\nKellie Castle\nKellie Castle is a castle just outside Arncroach and below the dominant hill in the area, Kellie Law. It is about 4 kilometres north of Pittenweem in the East Neuk of Fife, Scotland.\nEarly history\nThe earliest records of Kellie go back to 1150 where it is mentioned in a charter issued by King David I. The first known owner was Robert of London, the illegitimate son of King William the Lion. By 1266 Kellie had passed to the Siward family, who had hailed from Northumbria and had assisted King Malcolm Canmore to overthrow Macbeth. The Siewards supported England during the wars of independence (1296-1328) and as a result Sir Richard Sieward forfeited his lands in Scotland after Bannockburn. However his daughter Helena Sieward, “Lady Kellie” retained Kellie. None of the buildings they occupied appear to have survived.\nIn about 1360 Helena, or Elena, assigned Kellie to her kinsman Walter Olifard (or Oliphant) of Aberdalgie who was married to Elizabeth, a daughter of Robert the Bruce. Thus began 250 years of occupation by the Oliphant family. The estate was signed over to a Siward relative, Walter Oliphant, in 1360 and the castle remained in the ownership of the Oliphant family until 1613. It was purchased by Sir Thomas Erskine, who had saved the life of King James VI during the Gowrie Conspiracy by killing Sir Alexander Ruthven. The King stayed at Kellie in 1617 during his only visit to Scotland after the Union of the Crowns, and he appointed Erskine as Earl of Kellie in 1619.\nIt is likely that the ceiling of what is now the library in the 1573 east tower was decorated in plaster in anticipation of a Royal visit by King James. This room may be the first in Scotland where plaster decoration was used ‘in the London style’ in preference to the painted beams and boarded ceilings that were generally fashionable in the early 17th century. Incorporated in the ceiling is the date \"1617\" and monogram \"T V F\" for Thomas Viscount Fenton, which title the King awarded Thomas Erskine in 1606.\nKellie Castle (rear view)\nOriginally a simple tower house, the lower section of what now constitutes the northwest tower is the oldest part of the castle, dating from around 1360, and is said to be haunted. In 1573 a new tower was built by the 4th Lord Oliphant to the east of the original tower. It is believed that the 4th Lord built the east tower as a jointure-house (a property set aside for the wife after the husband's death) for his wife Margaret. Between 1573 and 1606 the two towers were linked by a new range, terminated by another tower in the south-west, creating the T-plan layout that remains today. The castle is a fine example of Scots Baronial domestic architecture, with an imposing mix of gables, corbelled towers, and chimneys.\nFor much of the seventeenth century, the Castle was owned by the Erskines of Dirleton. Alexander Erskine (1615-1677), the third earl of Kellie, was an investigator in the 1666 case of Margaret Guthrie, an accused witch from Carnbee.[1] She was imprisoned in the tolbooth at Anstruther Wester sometime in early May.\nRecent history\nMethven Erskine the 10th Earl of Kellie died in 1829 to be succeeded by John Francis Miller Erskine as 11th Earl of Kellie. The castle was abandoned by Erskine and cleared of its contents at a muckle roup (public auction) in 1830. John Francis Miller Erskine was confirmed as 26th Earl of Mar in 1835 and the Earldom of Kellie was united with the Earldom of Mar. The property then seems to have fallen to James Maitland Hog of Newliston (thereafter titled \"of Newliston and Kellie\") but Hog made little use of the estate, and the castle lay abandoned for many years.[citation needed] In 1878 it was rented from the Earl of Mar and Kellie by James Lorimer, Regius Professor of Public Law at Edinburgh University, and father to Sir Robert Lorimer, the renowned Scottish architect.[2] The Lorimer family set about restoring the castle for use as a holiday retreat, but it soon became the family home. Robert Lorimer was instrumental in much of the restoration work, restoring magnificent plaster ceilings, painted panelling and furniture.\nThere are examples of Robert Lorimer’s work as an architect across the world. At Kellie we have the doocot and garden house as well as the restoration of the garden with his sister Caroline-Louise. The Kellie Castle survey drawing (1887) featured at Kellie, illustrates his draftsmanship. Close to Kellie is the renovation and extension of Lundie Cottage (1902) in Arncroach. The interesting dormer windows can be seen from the roadway, opposite the church, as you drive west into the village.\nFollowing the death of the professor the tenancy was taken by his wife Hannah in 1890. Robert Lorimer began the first of his alterations in 1900: building a doocot and garden house.[3]\nOn the death of Hannah in 1916 the tenancy was taken over by their son, John Henry Lorimer the famous Scottish painter. Robert then began work on restoring the main house, this previously having been resisted by Hannah.[3]\nUpon John's death in 1936, the tenancy lapsed and the house was cleared and the castle once again became vacant. In 1936 Sir Robert's son, the sculptor Hew Lorimer and his wife Mary, renewed the Lorimer tenancy. Hew and Mary Lorimer purchased the castle in 1948 and it remained in his ownership until 1970. Between 1970 and 1990 Hew continued to live in part of the castle and used the stable block as his studio.\nKellie Castle Gardens\nPresent day\nHew Lorimer sold the castle, together with 6.5 hectares of gardens and an organic walled garden to the National Trust for Scotland in 1970. The walled garden is 17th century, with late Victorian additions, and contains a fine collection of old-fashioned roses, fruit trees and herbaceous plants.\nThe main castle contents were given into the care of the Trust by the Secretary of State for Scotland and, in 1998 the Trust purchased the Lorimer family artifacts. Amongst these artifacts are included paintings by Hannah Cassels im Thurn, the eldest daughter of Hannah and James Lorimer.[4] The castle and gardens are open to the public, and there is a permanent exhibition of Hew Lorimer's work and studio in the old stables.\nInterior\nPhoebe Anna Traquair, who was an outstanding proponent of the Arts and Crafts philosophy, completed the painted panel above the fireplace in the drawing room in 1897. The painting is based on Botticelli's Primavera and was completed when John Henry Lorimer lived in the castle. Hew and Mary Lorimer, who took over the tenancy after John Henry, apparently did not like the painting and they had it covered in the late 1940s. They were careful not to damage the painting and they used cartridge paper with flour paste. The painting was restored in 1996 by the National Trust for Scotland following the death of Hew Lorimer who had remained at Kellie and lived in part of the east tower of the castle until 1990.\nThe tapestry now in the dining room is made up of at least two, possibly three, different tapestries. The centre and main element is a Flemish tapestry (1580) that depicts Europa and the Bull. This tapestry used to be located in the drawing room as illustrated in a Country Life photograph taken in 1964. The beauty of Europa inspired the love of Zeus, who approached her in the form of a white bull. He carried her away from Phoenicia to Crete. The Latin inscription, which does not refer or relate to the main tapestry –‘The young man has saved his wounded father, carried him back and put him on his horse'. The borders have been added at some later time.\nIn the 1930s John Henry Lorimer was vice-president of what was then known as the Edinburgh Astronomical Association and now the Astronomical Society of Edinburgh. Upon his death in 1936 he left a substantial legacy to the society who now award a medal in his honour.[5] The society owns a bust of John Henry and two of his paintings. The bust and both paintings, “Sunlight in the South Room, Kellie” and “The Long Shadows”, are exhibited at Kellie Castle.\nThe largest room in the castle, used by the Lorimers as the drawing room, is the Great Hall, completed circa 1606. On the west wall are two mirrors with eagle cresting, designed by Sir Robert Lorimer and made by Whytock and Reid of Edinburgh. These mirrors, hanging on either side of the west window, appear to have a magical effect. No matter how far back you go, your image appears to stay the same size.\nSee also\nEarl of Kellie\nList of places in Fife\nList of National Trust for Scotland properties\nReferences\n^ Jones, Ciaran (2021).

    "text": "Macduff's Castle and the Wemyss Caves\nMacDuff's Castle is a ruined castle near East Wemyss, in Fife, Scotland. The site is associated with the MacDuff Earls of Fife, the most powerful family in Fife in the Middle Ages, although nothing survives from this period. The present ruins are the remains of the home of the Wemyss family, who lived here from the 14th century, and their successors in the 16th century.[1]\nHistory\nIt is thought that a castle may have been built here by the MacDuff Mormaers, or Earls, of Fife in the 11th century, at the time of King Macbeth of Scotland (d. 1057). The Wemyss family, descendants of the MacDuffs, owned the property from the 14th century, and built the earliest part of the present castle. Edward I of England paid a visit here in 1304, staying with Sir Michael Wemyss. However, Wemyss later joined forces with Robert the Bruce, and Edward ordered the castle to be destroyed.[citation needed]\nAfter the Wemyss family moved to nearby Wemyss Castle, it passed to the Livingstones, and then in 1530 it was taken over by the Colvilles who built a second tower to the south-west, and enclosed a courtyard with a gatehouse. In 1637 the castle was bought by Sir John Wemyss of West Wemyss, from Lord Colville of Culross, and in 1651 the lands of East and West Wemyss were united as a single barony.[1]\nDescription\nThe ruins formerly comprised the remains of a four-storey 14th-century tower, and a five-storey 16th-century tower.[1] The two were connected by a 16th-century gatehouse range, with 17th-century walls containing gun loops.[1][2] However the eastern tower was demolished by Fife County Council in 1967 after a child was injured falling from it. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[3] A 16th-century dovecote formerly stood at the edge of the shore to the south of the castle, but was destroyed by sea erosion in the 1970s.[4] The castle remains the property of the Wemyss Estate.[1]\nGhostlore\nLocal ghostlore states that the castle is supposedly haunted by a \"Grey Lady\", said to be a Mary Sibbald who was found guilty of theft and died in the castle.[5]\nImages\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Macduff's Castle.\nAerial view of the castle\n56°09′44″N 3°03′29″W / 56.16222°N 3.05806°W / 56.16222; -3.05806\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Rossend Castle\nPainted ceiling from the castle preserved in the National Museum of Scotland\nRossend Castle is a historic building in Burntisland, a town on the south coast of Fife, Scotland.\nHistory\nA keep, known as the Tower of Kingorne Wester, was in existence on the site from 1119. It was later referred to as Burntisland Castle, and by 1382 was called Abbot's Hall, as it was the home of the Abbot of Dunfermline.[1] The present building is largely of the 16th century, though with a 13th-century basement, which contains lancet windows and may represent the remains of a chapel.[2] It was rebuilt by Peter Durie of Durie from 1552, and the arms of Abbot George Durie, and the date 1554, appear over the main door.[1]\nDuring the war of the Rough Wooing the English soldier John Luttrell landed at Burntisland on 28 December 1547. He burnt boats and buildings at the pier, and the owners of Rossend surrendered the castle to him.[3]\nMary, Queen of Scots, visited during her short personal reign (1561–1567). On 14 February 1562, the French messenger and poet Chastelard was discovered hiding under Mary's bed in the castle.[4]\nOn 11 May 1590 Sir Robert Melville hosted the Danish Admiral Peder Munk who was travelling to Falkland Palace to take possession of the lands granted to Anne of Denmark as part of her dowry.[5]\nIn April 1594 James VI came to Rossend from Leith with his guard, and unsuccessfully tried to capture two rebel supporters of the Earl of Bothwell, Archibald Wauchope of Niddrie and John Wemyss of Logie.[6] Probably in the first decades of the 17th-century, Sir Robert Melville commissioned a painted timber ceiling. The scheme includes his initials \"SRM\" which he used as a seal on his letters, and pictorial emblems copied from the Devises Heroïques of Claude Paradin and other print sources. The ceiling may have been part of a redecoration of the castle in 1617, when King James planned to visit during his \"salmon-like\" return to Scotland. Melville was instructed to make \"his house of Burntyland patent\" for his majesty's reception. One of the documented Scottish painters of the period, James Workman, lived in Burntisland.[7]\nThe castle was captured in 1651 by the soldiers of Oliver Cromwell, and in the later 17th century it was owned by the Wemyss family, who remodelled the top floor.\nBy 1765, it was owned by Murdoch Campbell, a Highlander from Skye, who probably gave the building its current name.[1]\nIn 1915 Thomas Ross was arrested whilst studying the castle, for sketching in a prohibited area, and fined five shillings.\nThe castle was acquired by the Town Council in 1952. In 1957, the Scottish renaissance painted ceilings was discovered and is now displayed in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.[1] The council threatened to demolish the property, which had been allowed to deteriorate, but it was saved after a public inquiry in 1972.[8] In 1975, the castle was bought by the architecture firm Robert Hurd & Partners, who restored it and retain the building as their offices. It is a category B listed building.[1]\nIt was bought in 2019 by private owners who have restored it\nSee also\nRestoration of castles in Scotland\nReferences\n56°3′31.4″N 3°14′25.0″W / 56.058722°N 3.240278°W / 56.058722; -3.240278\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Fife, Scotland, UK\nNot to be confused with St Andrew's Castle, Hamble.\nSt Andrews Castle is a ruin located in the coastal Royal Burgh of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland. The castle sits on a rocky promontory overlooking a small beach called Castle Sands and the adjoining North Sea. There has been a castle standing at the site since the times of Bishop Roger (1189–1202), son of the Earl of Leicester. It housed the burgh’s wealthy and powerful bishops while St Andrews served as the ecclesiastical centre of Scotland during the years before the Protestant Reformation. In their Latin charters, the Archbishops of St Andrews wrote of the castle as their palace, signing, \"apud Palatium nostrum.\"[1]\nThe castle's grounds are now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.[2] The site is entered through a visitor centre with displays on its history. Some of the best surviving carved fragments from the castle are displayed in the centre, which also has a shop.\nWars of Scottish Independence\nDuring the Wars of Scottish Independence, the castle was destroyed and rebuilt several times as it changed hands between the Scots and the English. Soon after the sack of Berwick in 1296 by Edward I of England, the castle was taken and made ready for the English king in 1303. In 1314, however, after the Scottish victory at Bannockburn, the castle was retaken and repaired by Bishop William Lamberton, Guardian of Scotland, a loyal supporter of King Robert the Bruce. The English had recaptured it again by the 1330s and reinforced its defences in 1336, but were not successful in holding the castle. Sir Andrew Moray, Regent of Scotland in the absence of David II, recaptured it after a siege lasting three weeks. Shortly after this, in 1336–1337, it was destroyed by the Scots to prevent the English from once again using it as a stronghold.\nIt remained in this ruined state until Bishop Walter Trail rebuilt it at the turn of the century. His castle forms the basis of what can be seen today. He completed work on the castle in about 1400 and died within its walls in 1401.\nHome to kings\nSeveral notable figures spent time in the castle over the next several years. James I of Scotland (1406–1437) received part of his education from Bishop Henry Wardlaw, the founder of the University of St Andrews in 1410. A later resident, Bishop James Kennedy, was a trusted advisor of James II of Scotland (1437–1460).\nUsed as a prison\nDuring these years, the castle also served as a notorious prison. The castle's bottle dungeon is a dank and airless pit cut out of solid rock below the north-west tower. It housed local miscreants who fell under the Bishop's jurisdiction as well as several more prominent individuals such as David Stuart, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Murdoch Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany in 1425, while Archbishop Patrick Graham, who was judged to be insane and might have been imprisoned at this place for a while, actually died in captivity in Lochleven Castle in 1478.\nReformation and siege\nMain article: Siege of St Andrews Castle\nDuring the Scottish Reformation, the castle became a centre of religious persecution and controversy. Referring to the bottle dungeon the Scottish reformer, John Knox, wrote, \"Many of God's Children were imprisoned here.\" In 1521, James Beaton, then Archbishop of Glasgow, won the seat of St Andrews and took up residence in the castle. Beaton altered the defences to enable the castle to withstand a heavy artillery attack, which was a threat as tensions grew between English Protestants and Scottish Catholics. A new artillery blockhouse was constructed. In 1538 James Beaton was succeeded by his ambitious and wealthy nephew, Cardinal David Beaton.\nMuch is known about life at the castle from the account book of David Beaton. Beer was brewed by the Widow Fallousdale. In 1541 a whale beached at Byrehills (now Boarhills) was brought to the castle and salted. The Cardinal employed William Blair as a drummer. Onion and lettuce were grown in the castle garden. Two priests, Henry Balfour and James Bykartoun, were masters of work, supervising improvements to the castle and gardens. Christopher Grymmerschere, a French military engineer, provided guns, and Master Wolf made new cannon, and John Fynnyk was the castle gunner. Coal for the castle was shipped from West Wemyss.[3] Three women from Edinburgh and Dunfermline accused of witchcraft were held at the castle and executed by burning on 10 October 1542.[4]\nMine tunnel dug during the siege in 1546\nCardinal Beaton's strong opposition to the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, with Prince Edward (later King Edward VI), the son and heir of Henry VIII of England, helped to spark renewed fighting in 1544. Scottish Protestants were increasingly viewed as dangerous turncoats who sided with the English. In 1546 David Beaton imprisoned the Protestant preacher George Wishart (1513-1546) in the castle's Sea Tower and had him burnt at the stake in front of the castle walls on 1 March. Today, brick lettering with his initials marks the spot where he died. In May the same year, Wishart's friends conspired against the cardinal. On 26 May they gained entry to the castle by disguising themselves as masons when some building work was in progress. After overcoming the garrison, they murdered Cardinal Beaton and hung his body from his window on the front of the castle.\nFollowing this murder, the Protestants took refuge in the castle and formed the first Protestant congregation in Scotland. A long siege was ordered by the Scottish Regent, James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran. In October 1546 a mine was begun by the attackers which was successfully counter-mined by the defenders.[5] Both the mine and counter-mine cut through solid rock. They were rediscovered in 1879 and remain open to the public today. Arran heard that an English army was on its way to relieve the Castle and asked Fife Lairds like John Wemyss of that Ilk to come by 4 November 1546, bringing his followers and whatever artillery they had to resist a sea invasion.[6] Although Henry VIII made plans to assist the Protestants within the castle,[7] the invasion never came and his son Edward VI did not send aid.\nDuring an armistice in April 1547, John Knox entered the castle and served as the garrison's preacher for the remainder of the siege. For a time Knox had the freedom to pass to and from the castle to preach in the parish church. This peaceful interlude came to end, however, when a French fleet arrived bringing an Italian engineer Leone Strozzi who directed a devastating artillery bombardment to dislodge the Protestant lairds. The lairds knew an expert was in the field when their own Italian engineer observed cannon being winched into position with ropes rather than exposing the besiegers to their fire.[8] Guns were also placed on St Salvator's and the cathedral towers. One of the largest Scottish cannon was called \"thrawynmouthe.\"[9] The castle was quickly rendered indefensible, within six hours according to Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie.[10] The defeated Protestants were taken away with some imprisoned in France while others, including Knox, were condemned to the galleys.\nDecline and current condition\nBeaton's arms on a panel believed to have been removed from one of his private apartments in the castle\nFollowing this Protestant defeat, the castle was substantially rebuilt by Archbishop John Hamilton, the illegitimate brother of Regent Arran, and successor to Dr. David Cardinal Beaton. But following his death in 1571 it was mainly occupied by a succession of constables. Parliament separated the castle from the archbishopric in 1606, and it was granted to the Earl of Dunbar, constable since 1603. In 1612 it was returned to Archbishop George Gledstanes, but further attempts to re-establish the former estates of the Archbishop failed. With the eventual success of the Reformation in Scotland, the office of the bishop was increasingly eroded until it was finally abolished by William of Orange in 1689. Deprived of any function, the castle fell rapidly into ruin. By 1656 it had fallen into such disrepair that the burgh council ordered the use of its materials in repairing the pier. The principal remains are a portion of the south wall enclosing a square tower, the \"bottle dungeon,\" the kitchen tower, and the underground mine and counter-mine.\nGallery 1843-44 photo of St. Andrews Castle by Robert Adamson The courtyard of St Andrews Castle The ruins of St Andrews Castle from the south east The front of St Andrews Castle Inside St Andrews Castle St Andrews Castle reflected in the sea\nFootnotes\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to St Andrews Castle.\nHistoric Environment Scotland: Visitor guide\n56°20′31″N 2°47′24″W / 56.3419°N 2.7901°W / 56.3419; -2.7901\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

Crookston Castle was built by the Stewarts of Darnley around 1400, and is set within earthworks constructed in the 12th century. Once the property of the earls and dukes of Lennox, the castle was extensively repaired following a siege in 1544, and it is the only surviving medieval castle in Glasgow.\nHistory\nCrookston is surrounded by a defensive ring ditch that dates back to the 12th century when Sir Robert de Croc, who also gave his name to the village of Crookston, built a timber and earth castle. Remains of a chapel founded by de Croc in 1180 have been uncovered.[1] Evidence of an even earlier fortification on the same site has also been found. The lands of Crookston were bought by Sir Alan Stewart in 1330, and passed to Sir John Stewart of Darnley, in 1361. The Darnley Stewarts replaced the early castle with the present stone structure around 1400.[2][3]\nIn 1489 the Stewart Earl of Lennox rebelled against James IV. James responded by bringing the cannon Mons Meg from Edinburgh and bombarding the castle, virtually destroying its western end and ensuring a quick surrender.[4][5] On 3 April 1544, the castle was besieged and taken[2] by the Earl of Arran and Cardinal Beaton, while the then Earl of Lennox was defending Glasgow Castle. At this time, Crookston was regarded as the principal house of the earls of Lennox.[6] Regent Arran installed five gunners in the castle in May 1544.[7]\nMost famous of the Darnley Stewarts was Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who was second husband to Mary, Queen of Scots. It may have been at Crookston that the couple were betrothed,[8] under a yew tree.[5] The yew was felled in 1816,[9] and a model of Crookston Castle, now on display in Pollok House, was carved from its wood.[10] In 1572, Crookston was granted to another Stewart, Charles, the Earl of Lennox.[11]\nIn 1703 the Duke of Lennox sold the castle to the Duke of Montrose, and it remained the property of the Dukes of Montrose until 1757, when it was sold by William Graham, 2nd Duke of Montrose to the Maxwells of Pollok.[5] Following several years of abandonment, the castle was partially restored by the Maxwells in 1847, to honour Queen Victoria's visit to Glasgow. In 1931, Crookston became the first property acquired by the National Trust for Scotland, having been presented by Sir John Maxwell Stirling-Maxwell, who was one of the Trust's founder members and first Vice Presidents.[10] During the Second World War the north-eastern tower was used as an aircraft watch tower.[12] Today, Crookston Castle is a scheduled monument.[13] Its maintenance is the responsibility of Historic Environment Scotland, and the castle is open to the public.[14] It is the second-oldest building in Glasgow, after Glasgow Cathedral.[15]\nArchitecture\nCrookston Castle in 1900\nCrookston Castle sits atop a natural hill, emphasised by the early ring ditch, which can still be seen. To the north is a steep drop to the Levern Water. The castle has a rectangular main block, which was strengthened by a tower at each corner. This formed an irregular 'X-plan' shape, an unusual layout also seen at Hermitage Castle.[11] Only the north-east corner tower survives to its former height, as well as the basement of the south-east tower. The two western towers were destroyed in the 15th century and never rebuilt, repairs in the 19th century have obscured even the remains of these. The main body of the castle measures about 19 m by 12 m, with walls up to 3.7 m thick, and the north-east tower is around 6m square.[16]\nThe entrance is on the north side, adjacent to the north-east tower, and defended by a portcullis and two doors. A straight mural stair leads up to the right, while ahead is a barrel-vaulted basement with slit windows and a well. The hall is at first-floor level, and was also vaulted, rising to 8.3 m high. A turnpike stair in the south-east corner gave access to another storey above the hall, as well as upper rooms in the eastern towers. The towers had one room on each floor. In the basement of the north-east tower is a prison only accessible from above, while at the top there is access to the four storeys of the tower, via modern iron ladders, opening onto an impressive view from the roof. The top of the north-east tower, including corbels, was also rebuilt in the 19th century.\nVerse and fiction\nThe poets Robert Burns, William Motherwell and Robert Tannahill have all mentioned the castle in their works, while Sir Walter Scott, in his 1820 novel The Abbot, suggested Mary, Queen of Scots, watched the Battle of Langside from beneath its yew tree, although the topography makes this impossible.[17]\nNotes\nReferences\nCoventry, Martin The Castles of Scotland (3rd Edition), Goblinshead, 2001\nLindsay, Maurice The Castles of Scotland, Constable & Co. 1986\nMason, Gordon The Castles of Glasgow and the Clyde, Goblinshead, 2000\nSalter, Mike The Castles of South West Scotland, Folly Publications, 1993\nSee also\nCowden Hall, East Renfrewshire\nExternal links Media related to Crookston Castle at Wikimedia Commons\nHistoric Environment Scotland: Visitor guide\nAncient Scotland\nImages of Crookston Castle\n55°50′06″N 4°21′21″W / 55.83513°N 4.35584°W / 55.83513; -4.35584\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Medieval castle in Morvern, Scotland\nArdtornish Castle is a castle situated in the grounds of the Ardtornish estate in Morvern, on the west coast of Scotland. It stands at the seaward end of a promontory which extends in a southerly direction into the Sound of Mull, about 1 mile (2 kilometres) south-east of the village of Lochaline, Highland. It is protected as a scheduled monument.[1]\nHistory\n12th – 14th centuries: Clan Donald\nThe castle was one of the principal seats of the high chiefs of Clan Donald from the early 14th to late 15th century, but Somerled had a fortress here in the mid 12th century. Ardtornish was the hub of strategic sea lanes important to him. Later, it was at Ardtornish Castle that John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, 6th chief of Clan Donald died in the 1380s and from where his funeral procession sailed through the Sound of Mull to the island of Iona.\nHis son and successor, Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles granted charters dated at Ardtornish, at least two of which have survived, one in Latin and the other in Gaelic, and it was from here, according to tradition, that his galley fleet sailed on their way to transport the vassals of the Isles to the west coast of Ross-shire where they landed to begin their invasion in support of Donald's claim to the Earldom of Ross which resulted in the indecisive Battle of Harlaw in 1411.\nAlso at Ardtornish Castle, John's great-grandson, also named John of Islay, the fourth and last Lord of the Isles, met the commissioners of King Edward IV of England in 1461 to negotiate the well-known Treaty of Ardtornish-Westminster by which, in return for becoming loyal subjects of the King of England, John, his kinsman Donald Balloch of Dunnyvaig and the Glens and the forfeited Earl of Douglas were each to have a third of the kingdom of Scotland, with generous pecuniary rewards until the conquest of the kingdom had been completed.\n15th – 17th centuries: Clan MacLean and abandonment\nThe revelation of this treaty by the English government to the government of Scotland in 1474 resulted in the loss of the Earldom of Ross the following year. In the 1493 aftermath of the Raid on Ross, a decade or so later, John's final forfeiture as Lord of the Isles followed. Following this, the lands of Ardtornish remained for a time in the hands of the Crown but were eventually given to the Clan MacLean chief of Duart Castle, who had already acquired large tracts of land in Morvern.\nThe castle was probably abandoned around the end of the seventeenth century, by which time Ardtornish and the other Morvern estates of the MacLeans had been captured by the Campbell Earls of Argyll.\nReferences\n^ Historic Environment Scotland. \"Ardtornish Castle (SM2906)\".

    "text": "Baronial style mansion built in 1880 and incorporating older building work\nBeaufort Castle under construction in the late 1870s – the 13th Lord Lovat is shown at right\nBeaufort Castle or Castle Dounie (Scottish Gaelic: Caisteal Dhùnaidh) is a Baronial style mansion built in 1880 and incorporating older building work.[1] It is situated on the right bank of the River Beauly near the town of Beauly in Inverness-shire and is 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Kiltarlity and 13 mi (21 km) west of Inverness.[1] There has been a castle on the site since the 12th century. Beaufort Castle is the traditional seat of the Lords Lovat, Chiefs of Clan Fraser of Lovat.\nHistory\nThe earliest mention of the site, as Downie or Dounie Castle, occurs in the reign of Alexander I (1106–1124), when a siege took place.[2] The original castle was built by the Byset family. The castle came into the hands of the Frasers in the late 13th century. English forces besieged the castle in 1303.\nThe main tower of Beaufort Castle\nIn the 1650s Dounie was attacked and burned by the forces of Oliver Cromwell during their invasion of Scotland.[3]\nThe Fraser estates were inherited by Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat (c.1667–1747), in 1699. Known as 'The Fox', Lovat became deeply involved in the Jacobite cause, which aimed to restore the deposed House of Stuart to the thrones of Scotland and England. Exiled to France, Lovat joined James Stuart, the Old Pretender, and converted to Catholicism. He attempted to recruit Scottish nobles to the cause, carrying messages to Scotland, but his dealings led to ten years imprisonment in France. Returning in 1714, he apparently renounced the Jacobite cause in return for possession of his estates. In the 1740s he commissioned William Adam to design a new house at Dounie. Adam's last work, the project only progressed to the supply of stonework to the site: construction never started since the Jacobite Rising of 1745 intervened.[4] Lovat, changing allegiance again, supported the Jacobites, but was captured and executed after the Battle of Culloden. Dounie Castle was razed by the Duke of Cumberland, and the estate was declared forfeit.[2]\nFrom 1746 the estate was run by the Forfeited Estates Commissioners, appointed by Parliament to dispose of confiscated estates, and a small house was built on the site of the demolished castle to house the factor (estate manager). In 1774 the estate was returned to Lovat's son, Simon Fraser of Lovat (1726–1782), who had raised and commanded the 78th Fraser Highlanders for the British Army.[2] Proposals for a new house on the site were put forward in 1777 but not executed. In 1815 the estate was inherited by Thomas Fraser of Strichen (1802–1875), who was reinstated to the Lordship of Lovat in 1854. In 1839 he commissioned William Burn to extend the house, and also improved the grounds and estate. His son Simon Fraser, 13th Lord Lovat (1828–1887), built the present Beaufort Castle, to designs by James Maitland Wardrop, incorporating part of the 18th-century house.[5]\nSimon Fraser, Master of Lovat accumulated an estimated seven million pounds sterling (£7,000,000)[6] in debts. The castle was sold in 1994 to Stagecoach director Ann Gloag by the 15th Lord Lovat, to meet inheritance taxes.[7][8]\nDescription\nThe Baronial mansion incorporates a private Roman Catholic chapel.[5] The remains of Dounie Castle stand beside the house, and consist of a single wall, 11 metres (36 ft) long and 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) high, with a plaque stating that it is \"the ruin of Castle Downie, the ancient stronghold of the Frasers of Lovat, built c. 1400, and destroyed by Cumberland after the battle of Culloden\".[3]\nThe house is a category A listed building.[5] The grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national listing of significant gardens in Scotland.[2]\nSee also\nCastles in Great Britain and Ireland\nList of castles in Scotland\nReferences\nExternal links Media related to Beaufort Castle at Wikimedia Commons\n57°27′11″N 4°29′24″W / 57.45306°N 4.49000°W / 57.45306; -4.49000\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "\"Castle Moil\" redirects here. For the castle in Argyll and Bute, see Moil Castle, Argyll and Bute.\nCastle in Isle of Skye, Scotland\nCaisteal Maol (Gaelic: Caisteal, 'Castle', Maol, 'bare') is a ruined castle located near the harbour of the village of Kyleakin, Isle of Skye, Scotland. It is also known as Castle Moil, Castle Maol, Dun Akyn, Dunakin Castle,[1] Dun Haakon and Castle Dunakin.[2]\nRecreation of the 16th century exterior\nHistory\nThe castle, an ancient seat of the Mackinnon clan, was a fortress commanding the strait of Kyle Akin between Skye and the mainland, through which all ships had to pass or else attempt the stormy passage of The Minch. The present building dates back to the 15th century, but is traditionally reputed to be of much earlier origin.\nAccording to that tradition, Alpín mac Echdach's great-grandson Findanus, the 4th MacKinnon chief, brought Dunakin into the clan around the year 900 by marrying a Norse princess nicknamed 'Saucy Mary'. Findanus and his bride ran a heavy chain across the sound and levied a toll on all shipping vessels.[3] The Princess lies buried on Beinn na Caillich on Skye, her face reputedly turned towards Norway.\nWhatever the veracity of the castle's traditional history, there is good reason for supposing the existence of a connection of some kind with Norway. King Haakon IV is thought to have assembled his fleet of longships there before the Battle of Largs in 1263 (hence the name Kyleakin – Haakon's kyle). Haakon's defeat at Largs effectively ended Norse domination of the Scottish islands.[4] Medieval and early modern documents also refer to the castle itself as Dunakin (Dun-Haakon), which is again strongly suggestive of a Norse connection. Interior view of the large window on the first level – the thickness of the walls is apparent\nThe present structure is of late 15th or early 16th century construction. This is supported by historical documents and carbon dating. In 1513, a meeting of chiefs was held here and they agreed to support Donald MacDonald as Lord of the Isles. The last occupant of the castle was Neill MacKinnon, nephew of the 26th chief of the clan (c. 1601).[5]\nDescription\nThe castle occupies a headland above the village of Kyleakin facing the village of Kyle of Lochalsh across the strait. It is a simple rectangular keep of three stories. The unexplored basement level is filled with rubble and other debris and is believed to have contained the kitchen. The visitor today enters on the main level where the public dining space would have been. Stairs would have led up to the private apartments above.[5]\nThe castle is almost completely ruined. In 1949 and 1989 parts of the ruins broke away in storms. The remaining ruins have been secured to prevent further deterioration.[6] No excavation of the ruins has been carried out, nor are planned. On 14 February 2018, a lightning strike destroyed part of the ruins;[7] they have subsequently been stabilised.[8]\nReferences\n^ \"Castle Moil, Kyleakin\". UK Attraction.

    "text": "Castle in Dingwall, Scotland\nThis folly is said to have been built from the stones of Dingwall Castle, on the site of the castle and is one of the few surviving relics of Dingwall Castle.\nDingwall Castle was a medieval fort and royal castle in the town of Dingwall, eastern Ross-shire, Scotland.\nThe castle is believed to have been established by Norse settlers in the area in the 11th century.[1]\nWars of Scottish Independence\nDuring the Wars of Scottish Independence the castle was garrisoned by the forces of Edward I of England. However it was later captured by Scottish forces for Robert the Bruce led by Uilleam II, Earl of Ross.[1]\nFrom the castle, the Earl of Ross (chief of Clan Ross) led the men of Ross to fight against the English at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. As a reward in 1321 King Robert granted Dingwall Castle with the town and lands of Dingwall to the Earl of Ross.[1]\nMurder in the Castle\nThese broken walls are the only remaining ruins of the original Dingwall Castle\nIn 1370 a feud arose between William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland (chief of Clan Sutherland) and Iye Mackay, 4th of Strathnaver (chief of Clan Mackay). A meeting was arranged for them to meet at Dingwall Castle to resolve their issues.[2] However, Iye Mackay and his son Donald Mackay were both murdered in the castle while they were asleep by Nicholas Sutherland, 1st of Duffus, brother of the Earl of Sutherland.[2] See page: Iye Mackay, 4th of Strathnaver for a detailed explanation of the feud.\nDuel\nSometime at the beginning of the 15th century a duel is said to have taken place between the governor of the castle, who had been appointed by Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany and Thomas Munro, brother of Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis (chief of Clan Munro). The two met at the village of Maryburgh and after an argument dirks were pulled and a duel took place in which Thomas Munro killed the governor of Dingwall Castle.[3] The Scottish Castles Association states that the new governor of the castle was \"assassinated\" by one of the Munroes and replaced by a Mackay.[4]\nLord of the Isles occupation\nIn 1411 Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles (chief of Clan Donald) captured Dingwall Castle as part of his pursuit of his claim to the earldom of Ross by right of his wife, Mariota Leslie. This took place shortly before the Battle of Harlaw.[5]\nIn 1436 the next successive Clan Donald chief, Alexander of Islay, Earl of Ross was officially recognized as the Earl of Ross and took up his residence at Dingwall Castle. His son, John of Islay, Earl of Ross was not as successful; the Earldom of Ross was confiscated and the castle became a royal possession once more in 1475.[1] John Munro, 11th Baron of Foulis was then made governor of the castle, who in turn was succeeded by Andrew Munro, 2nd of Milntown.[4] The next governor in 1488 was Sir James Dunbar.[4]\n16th century\nIn 1507 Andrew Stewart, Bishop of Caithness carried out improvements after the castle had been assaulted by the MacDonalds and Mackenzies,[4] and a new great hall was built.[6] Later governors were John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl (1516 - 1522), John Earl of Moray - brother of James V of Scotland, David Sinclair - until 1550, George Munro, 4th of Milntown also known as \"of Docharty\" in 1561, Sir Andrew Keith, (Lord Dingwall), in 1584, Sir John Preston, later Earl of Desmond, in 1605.[4]\nDownfall\nThe Crown abandoned Dingwall Castle in about 1600 and it eventually fell into a ruin. The castle ceased to be maintained after the death of King James VI of Scotland in 1625.[4] It was used as a quarry until 1817 when it was finally levelled and only a few fragments remain.[1] The remains are protected as a scheduled monument.[7]\nTunnel\nA tunnel still exists that runs from the site of Dingwall Castle to the basement of nearby Tulloch Castle. The tunnel has now collapsed, but it is possible to view this passageway through an air vent on the front lawn of Tulloch Castle's grounds.[8][9][10]\nReferences\nExternal links\nRoyal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland: Record for Dingwall Castle\n57°35′52″N 4°25′19″W / 57.59770°N 4.42195°W / 57.59770; -4.42195\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

For the ocean liner, see HMS Dunvegan Castle.\nDunvegan Castle (Caisteal Dhùn Bheagain) is located 1 mile (1.6 km) to the north of Dunvegan on the Isle of Skye, off the west coast of Scotland. It is the seat of the MacLeod of MacLeod, chief of the Clan MacLeod. Probably a fortified site from the earliest times, the castle was first built in the 13th century and developed piecemeal over the centuries. In the 19th century the whole castle was remodelled in a mock-medieval style. The castle is built on an elevated rock overlooking an inlet on the eastern shore of Loch Dunvegan, a sea loch.\nHistory\nThe promontory was enclosed by a curtain wall in the 13th century, and a four-storey tower house was built in the late 14th century. This tower was similar in style to contemporary structures at Kisimul Castle and Caisteal Maol.[1] Alasdair Crotach, the 8th chief, added the Fairy Tower as a separate building around 1500. During the 17th century, new ranges of buildings were put up between the old tower and the Fairy Tower, beginning in 1623 with the state apartment built by Ruairidh Mòr. The old tower was subsequently abandoned until the late 18th century, when the 23rd chief began the process of homogenising the appearance of the castle. This process continued under the 24th and 25th chiefs, with the addition of mock battlements and the new approach over a drawbridge from the east. The present appearance of the castle dates from around 1840 when this process of \"baronialisation\" was completed.[1] The castle is a Category A listed building.[2]\nSite\nDunvegan Castle occupies the summit of a rock some 50 feet (15 m) above sea level, which projects on to the eastern shore of a north-facing inlet or bay. On the eastern, landward side of the site is a partly natural ditch around 18 feet (5.5 m) deep.[1]\nArtifacts\nNotable family heirlooms kept at Dunvegan Castle include:\nDunvegan Cup\nFairy Flag\nSir Rory Mor's Horn\nImages Round Garden, Dunvegan Castle The Walled Garden, Dunvegan Castle Dunvegan Castle Dunvegan Castle entrance Dunvegan Castle port Artist's impression of the castle c. 1500\nLiterature\nThe Mystery at Dunvegan Castle a novel by T.L.

    "text": "Small tidal island in the western Highlands of Scotland\nEilean Donan (Scottish Gaelic: Eilean Donnain) is a small tidal island situated at the confluence of three sea lochs (Loch Duich, Loch Long and Loch Alsh) in the western Highlands of Scotland, about 1 kilometre (5⁄8 mi) from the village of Dornie. It is connected to the mainland by a footbridge that was installed early in the 20th century and is dominated by a picturesque castle that frequently appears in photographs, film and television. The island's original castle was built in the thirteenth century; it became a stronghold of the Clan Mackenzie and their allies, the Clan MacRae. In response to the Mackenzies' involvement in the Jacobite rebellions early in the 18th century, government ships destroyed the castle in 1719. The present-day castle is Lieutenant-Colonel John Macrae-Gilstrap's 20th-century reconstruction of the old castle.[2]\nEilean Donan is part of the Kintail National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.[3] In 2001, the island had a recorded population of just one person,[4] but there were no \"usual residents\" at the time of the 2011 census.[1]\nEilean Donan, which means simply \"island of Donnán\", is named after Donnán of Eigg, a Celtic saint who was martyred in 617. Donnán is said to have established a church on the island, though no trace of this remains.[2]\nHistory\nIt is possible that an early Christian monastic cell was founded on the island in the 6th or 7th century, and that it was dedicated to Donnán of Eigg, an Irish saint who was martyred on Eigg in April 617. No remains of any Christian buildings survive, though fragments of vitrified stone (stone that has been subjected to very high temperatures) have been discovered, indicating that there was an Iron Age or early medieval fortification on the island.[5][6]\nOrigins of the castle\nIn the earlier thirteenth century, during the reign of Alexander II (ruled 1214–1249), a large curtain-wall castle (wall of enceinte) was constructed; it enclosed much of the island.[2] At this time, the area around the island was at the boundary of the Norse-Celtic Lordship of the Isles and the Earldom of Ross: Eilean Donan provided a strong defensive position against Norse expeditions.[7] A founding legend has it that the son of a chief of the Mathesons acquired the power to communicate with birds; as a result of this power, and after many adventures overseas, he gained wealth, power, and the respect of Alexander II, who asked him to build the castle to defend his realm.[8]\nAt a later date, the island became a stronghold of the Mackenzies of Kintail, originally vassals of William I, Earl of Ross.[2] At this early stage, the castle is said to have been garrisoned by Macraes and Maclennans, both clans that were later closely associated with the Mackenzies.[9] Traditional Mackenzie clan histories relate that Earl William sought advantage from the Treaty of Perth of 1266, by which King Magnus VI of Norway ceded the Hebrides to Scotland, and demanded that his kinsman Kenneth Mackenzie return the castle to allow his expansion into the islands. Mackenzie refused, and Earl William led an assault against Eilean Donan that the Mackenzies and their allies repulsed.[10]\nThe Mackenzie clan histories also claim (with little, if any, supporting contemporary evidence), that Robert the Bruce sheltered at Eilean Donan during the winter of 1306 to 1307; the castle escaped any other involvement in the Wars of Scottish Independence.[11] In 1331 Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, sent an officer to Eilean Donan to warn the occupants of his forthcoming visit. In preparation 50 wrongdoers were rounded up and executed, their heads being displayed on the castle walls to Moray's approval.[10] By the middle of the 14th century the Mackenzies are said to have been on the losing side in the ongoing feuding with the Earls of Ross. William III, Earl of Ross granted Kintail to Raghnall Mac Ruaidhrí in 1342. With the assistance of Leod Macgilleandrais, the Earl allegedly apprehended Kenneth Mackenzie, 3rd of Kintail, and had him executed in 1346 at Inverness. Through this period Eilean Donan is said to have been held by Duncan Macaulay for the Mackenzies, against the Earl and his allies.[12] Kenneth's young son Murdo Mackenzie supposedly evaded the Earl's attempts to eliminate him, and on the return of David II from exile Murdo Mackenzie was allegedly confirmed in the lands of Kintail and Eilean Donan by a charter of 1362 (of which, however, no trace survives to the present day).[13][14] At some point in the earlier 14th century it is thought that the Clan Macrae began to settle in Kintail as a body, having migrated from the Beauly Firth, and there gained the trust of the Mackenzie lairds through possible kinship and an advantageous marriage. The Macraes began to act as Mackenzie's bodyguards, acquiring the soubriquet \"Mackenzie's shirt of mail\".[15]\nClan feuding\nAerial view of Eilean Donan\nJames I, determined to pacify the Highlands, journeyed to Inverness in 1427 and invited the principal chiefs to meet him there. Allegedly among them was the young Alexander Mackenzie, 6th Earl of Kintail. James then arrested him, along with the other chiefs, on their arrival. Mackenzie clan histories relate that, although several chiefs were executed or imprisoned, Alexander, due to his youth, was instead sent to Perth to attend school. Alexander's uncles attempted to seize control of Kintail, but the constable Duncan Macaulay continued to hold Eilean Donan on his behalf. Fionnla Dubh mac Gillechriosd, considered by clan historians to be the founder of the Clan Macrae in Kintail,[16] was dispatched to fetch the young laird back.[17] During his lairdship Alexander appears to have supported the monarchy against the MacDonald Lords of the Isles and was allegedly rewarded by another charter of Kintail in 1463.[18] Alexander died in about 1488 at a great age, and was succeeded by Kenneth Mackenzie, 7th of Kintail who won the Battle of Blar Na Pairce against the MacDonalds.[19] Kenneth died a few years later and was succeeded first by his eldest son, then on his death in 1497 by his second son, John of Killin, who was still a minor. His uncle, Hector Roy Mackenzie, attempted to usurp the Mackenzie lands and installed his own constable in Eilean Donan, Malcolm Mac Ian Charrich Macrae.[20] Hector's lawless activities caused the Mackenzies to be branded rebels, and in 1503 the Earl of Huntly offered to deliver Eilean Donan to the king, and to hold it on his behalf. James IV supplied a ship to support the enterprise.[21] Eventually, John compelled his uncle to relinquish his claim, and Hector agreed to hand over Eilean Donan. The constable refused however, and John's supporters laid siege. Malcolm Mac Ian Charrich was eventually persuaded by Hector to relinquish the castle, after which he was dismissed as constable and Christopher Macrae (Gillechriosd Mac Fionnlagh Mhic Rath) was appointed in his place in around 1511.[20][22] John of Killin obtained a further charter of Kintail and Eilean Donan in 1509.[2]\nIn 1539, Donald Gorm Macdonald of Sleat ravaged the lands of MacLeod of Dunvegan on Skye and then attacked the Mackenzie lands of Kinlochewe, where Miles (Maolmure), brother of Christopher Macrae, was killed. After a series of retaliatory raids, Donald Gorm learned that Eilean Donan was weakly garrisoned and launched a surprise attack.[23] In fact, only two people were in the castle: the recently appointed constable Iain Dubh Matheson and the warden. Duncan MacGillechriosd of the Clan Macrae, son of the former constable, arrived at the start of the attack and killed several MacDonalds at the postern gate.[24] Arrows launched by the attackers killed Matheson and the warden, but MacGillechriosd managed to hit Donald Gorm with his last arrow, fatally wounding Gorm, and the Macdonalds retreated.[25] Duncan MacGillechriosd expected to be appointed as the new constable but was considered too headstrong: the local clergyman John MacMhurchaidh Dhuibh (John Murchison) was appointed as a compromise between rival Macrae and Maclennan interests. Furious at this treatment, MacGillechriosd left Kintail and joined the service of Lord Lovat, though he eventually returned to settle at Inverinate. Meanwhile, an aggrieved Maclennan apparently shot MacMhurchaidh in the buttocks with an arrow.[26]\nMacGillechriosd's son Christopher Macrae became constable of Eilean Donan in turn, and held the castle during yet another clan feud, this time between the Mackenzies and the MacDonalds of Glengarry.[27] Feuding broke out in 1580 and continued for almost 25 years. In around 1602 Eilean Donan was the base for a sea skirmish at the narrows of Kyle Rhea led by Christopher's son Duncan. During the action the MacDonalds were driven on to the Cailleach Rock at the eastern tip of Skye and Angus, son of MacDonald of Glengarry, was killed.[28] Christopher was succeeded as constable by the Rev. Murdoch Murchison, minister of Kintail.[29]\n17th century\nKenneth Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Seaforth, was brought up at Eilean Donan by Rev. Farquhar Macrae\nThe Rev. Farquhar Macrae, son of Christopher Macrae, was born at the castle in 1580. After attending Edinburgh University and taking holy orders, in 1618 he was appointed constable of the castle and minister of Kintail on the death of Murdoch Murchison.[30] Colin Mackenzie of Kintail was created Earl of Seaforth in 1623. He lived mainly at Chanonry of Ross in Fortrose, but made regular visits to Eilean Donan where the constable was required to entertain him and his retinue of between 300 and 500 retainers, as well as the neighbouring lairds.[31] In 1635 George Mackenzie, 2nd Earl of Seaforth, appointed Farquhar as tutor to his six-year-old son Kenneth, who was subsequently raised at Eilean Donan.[32]\nIn the civil wars of the mid 17th century, the Earl of Seaforth sided with Charles I. In 1650, after the king's execution, the Parliament of Scotland ordered a garrison to Eilean Donan. The local people did not welcome the garrison. When a party of 30 soldiers came out from the castle to request provisions from the local people, a band of 10 men who opposed their demands met the occupiers. An argument broke out, which led to the garrison men being driven off with several casualties. Shortly thereafter the garrison departed.[33] The following year the Earl's brother, Simon Mackenzie of Lochslin, gathered troops for the royalist cause around Eilean Donan. For reasons unrecorded, he fell out with Farquhar Macrae and demanded his removal from the castle. Farquhar initially resisted, and despite interventions by the young Kenneth, had to be marched out by Lochslin and George Mackenzie (later Earl of Cromartie). He was finally persuaded to leave without violence, stating that he was too old to dwell in the cold castle.[34] Farquhar was thus the last constable to dwell in Eilean Donan until its reconstruction, although he retained the ministry of Kintail until his death in 1662, at the age of 82.[35]\nAfter this time, the castle was briefly occupied by the Earl of Balcarres and his wife,[36] who were in the Highlands in support of the Earl of Glencairn's royalist uprising, although Balcarres later disagreed with Glencairn and departed.[37] In June 1654 General Monck, Oliver Cromwell's military governor in Scotland, marched through Kintail while suppressing the uprising. His troops destroyed much property, and stole 360 of Farquhar Macrae's cattle, though only one man was killed.[38]\nJacobite rising and destruction of the castle\nMain article: Capture of Eilean Donan Castle\nIn 1689, King James VII of the House of Stuart was declared to have to forfeit the throne, and the crown was offered to William of Orange, in the so-called \"Glorious Revolution\". The revolution also established Presbyterianism in Scotland, although the Highlands generally remained Roman Catholic and loyal to the Stuarts. A series of Jacobite risings followed, leading to an increased military presence in Scotland as government forces attempted to penetrate and subdue the Highlands. In 1714 while surveying fortifications for the government, the military engineer Lewis Petit made the only surviving drawing of Eilean Donan. The sketch-elevation and carefully drawn plan show a dilapidated castle, largely roofless but for a small building by the entrance.[39]\nA major Jacobite uprising took place in 1715. Led by the Earl of Mar, it was an attempt to restore the exiled James Stuart, the \"Old Pretender\", to the throne. William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth, joined the Jacobite army, leading out men of the Clan Mackenzie and Clan Macrae. The Macraes mustered at Eilean Donan, and are said to have danced on the roof of the castle before setting out to the Battle of Sheriffmuir where 58 Macraes were among the Jacobite dead. The battle was indecisive and the rising collapsed soon after.\nFollowing the failure of the rising of 1715, the Jacobites found new support from Spain, now opposing both Britain and France in the War of the Quadruple Alliance. The Duke of Ormonde led the main invasion fleet from Spain, while an advance party of 300 Spanish soldiers under George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal, arrived in Loch Duich in April 1719, and occupied Eilean Donan Castle. The expected uprising of Highlanders did not occur, and the main Spanish invasion force never arrived. At the beginning of May, the Royal Navy sent ships to the area. Early in the morning on Sunday 10 May 1719 HMS Worcester, HMS Flamborough and HMS Enterprise anchored off Eilean Donan and sent a boat ashore under a flag of truce to negotiate. When the Spanish soldiers in the castle fired at the boat, it was recalled and all three frigates opened fire on the castle for an hour or more.[40] The next day the bombardment continued while a landing party was prepared. In the evening under the cover of an intense cannonade, a detachment went ashore in the ships' boats and captured the castle against little resistance. According to Worcester's log, in the castle were \"an Irishman, a captain, a Spanish lieutenant, a serjeant, one Scottish rebel and 39 Spanish soldiers, 343 barrels of powder and 52 barrels of musquet shot.\"[41] The naval force spent the next two days in the castle and landed 27 barrels of gunpowder. The frigates' official logs are curiously worded, perhaps to conceal the reputed fact that the Macraes succeeded in destroying the castle although in naval hands, in order to prevent the English from garrisoning it: at all events, the castle was demolished by the gunpowder exploding.[42] Flamborough then took the Spanish prisoners to Edinburgh.[43] The remaining Spanish troops were defeated on 10 June at the Battle of Glen Shiel.[44]\nRestoration and reuse\nCastle ruins, sometime before 1911\nBetween 1919 and 1932, the castle was rebuilt by Lt. Col. John MacRae-Gilstrap. The restoration included the construction of an arched bridge to give easier access to the island. Macrae-Gilstrap also established a war memorial dedicated to the men of the MacRae clan who died in the First World War. The memorial is adorned with lines from John McCrae's poem \"In Flanders Fields\", and is flanked by grey field guns from the war. Eilean Donan was opened to the public in 1955,[45] and has since become a popular attraction: over 314,000 people visited in 2009, making it the third-most-visited castle in Scotland.[46] In 1983 ownership of the castle was transferred to the Conchra Charitable Trust, established by the Macrae family to maintain and restore the castle,[47] and a purpose-built visitor centre was opened on the landward side of the bridge in 1998.[48]\nClan MacRae Roll of Honour inside Eilean Donan Castle grounds, added during the restoration.\nThe castle is regularly described as one of the most photographed monuments in Scotland,[49][50] and is a recognised Scottish icon, frequently appearing on packaging and advertising for shortbread, whisky and other products.[51][52] Eilean Donan has made several appearances in films, beginning with Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1948 and The Master of Ballantrae in 1953.[53] It featured in the opening episode of the 1976 TV series, The New Avengers. The castle was the setting for the 1980 short film Black Angel, filmed to accompany screenings of The Empire Strikes Back in cinemas.[54] In 1984, Scottish singer and composer Jesse Rae filmed his music video \"Over The Sea\" at the location.[55][56] It featured prominently in Highlander (1986) as the home of Clan MacLeod.[57] It was the backdrop to a dance scene in the Bollywood movie Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in 1998.[58] In 1999, it served as the Scottish headquarters of MI6 in The World Is Not Enough.[57] In 2007, Eilean Donan stood in for Fotheringhay Castle in England in Elizabeth: The Golden Age.[59] In the movie Made of Honor Eilean Donan can be seen as home of the groom's family.[57] The Tamil song \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" from the movie of the same name was filmed in this location.[60]\nArchitectural development\nEilean Donan Castle went through several phases of development from the earliest fortifications of the 13th century through to its destruction in 1719, and the subsequent reconstruction in the 20th century. The first phase comprised a curtain wall enclosing much of the island with a tower house added in the 14th century. In the 14th or 15th century the outer wall was abandoned and a smaller enclosure built around the tower house. More development within this courtyard took place in the 16th century, as well as the addition of defences on the eastern side. The castle was almost totally destroyed in 1719, after which almost 200 years passed before reconstruction began. Although some archaeological evidence has been recovered from the island, much material was lost during the reconstruction works making it difficult to build a clear picture of the early castle. Very little historical evidence survives.[61] Mapmaker Timothy Pont (c. 1565–1614) left a description:\nThe castell of Ylen Donen is composed of a strong and fair dungeon [i.e. a donjon or keep] upon a rock, with another tower compasd with a fair barmkin wall, with orchards and trees, al within ane yland of the lenth of twa pair of butts [i.e. archery butts] almost round. It is sayd of old that castel consisted of seven tours.[61]\nThe only drawing of the castle prior to its destruction was made in 1714 by Lewis Petit (c. 1665–1720), a military engineer with the Board of Ordnance who came to Scotland in 1714 to survey Fort William and other defences in the area.[62] Among the drawings he produced are a plan and elevation of Eilean Donan, which clearly show that the castle was largely derelict by this time, with only a building at the southeast corner being roofed.[39]\nDevelopment of Eilean Donan CastleThe 13th-century curtain wall enclosed most of the islandThe smaller enclosure in the 15th century, and the 16th-century buildingsAddition of the \"hornwork\" in the later 16th centuryFollowing reconstruction in the 20th century\nEarly enclosure\nIn the 13th century, a curtain wall or wall of enceinte was constructed around the island, enclosing most of the area above the high tide line. Scant remains of these walls can be traced on the ground, running around the northern end of the island. The eastern and southern segments of this wall are largely obscured by later development, although the enclosure is assumed to have contained an area of around 3,000 square metres (32,000 square feet).[63] At the northern point of the wall the foundations of a large tower survive, measuring around 12 by 13 metres (39 by 43 ft) and the remains of foundations suggest further towers at the north-east and southwest corners of the enclosure. The enclosure was accessed via a sea-gate in the north-west curtain wall, where a small beach would have allowed boats to be drawn up. Another beach to the southwest may have formed a second access.[63] Archaeological excavations in 2008 and 2009 confirmed the presence of these walls, and also found evidence that metalworking was taking place in the northern part of the castle.[64][65] A tower house or keep was built against the curtain wall at the high point of the island, probably in the 14th century.[66] The tower measured 16.5 by 12.4 m (54 ft 2 in by 40 ft 8 in), with walls 3 m (9 ft 10 in) thick. The vaulted ground floor was originally divided in two, with a stair in the north wall giving access to the first-floor hall. Above this were probably another two storeys, including a garret. The tower, according to Petit's later drawing, was topped by crowstep gables, and surrounded by a walkway and bartizans (small turrets) at the corners.[67]\nReduced castle\nAt an unknown period, probably in the later 14th century or early 15th century, the outer wall was abandoned in favour of a smaller defensive enclosure, around 25 m (82 ft) square. The entrance to this smaller courtyard was from the east. The reasons for this change are unclear, though it is suggested that the smaller area would have been easier to defend.[68] During the 16th century, two buildings were added to the southern periphery of the enclosure. A small house was constructed within the southeast angle of the wall, with a circular stair-tower on its northern side giving access to the walkway along the eastern curtain wall. Located just inside the gate, this is likely to have served as a house for the castle's constable or keeper, and is the only building shown with a roof on Petit's survey.[69] At the southwest corner of the enclosure, an L-plan block was put up, possibly as late as the early 17th century. The southern part is sited outside the line of the inner curtain wall, with a northern wing, which may have been a slightly later addition, inside the wall.[70]\nHornwork\nThe reconstructed entrance to the castle\nA mural chamber within the keep\nIn the later 16th century, the castle was extended eastward to create a bastion or \"hornwork\", providing a more securely defended entrance. The hornwork comprises a pair of walls enclosing a triangular courtyard, linking the east wall of the castle with an irregular hexagonal (or heptagonal) structure. This structure, 11.5 m (37 ft 9 in) across, contains a well at its lowest level, 5 m (16 ft) across and 10 m (33 ft) deep.[71] This led MacGibbon and Ross to describe the structure as a water tower or cistern.[72] However, the presence of a door on its eastern side is shown in 19th century photographs, indicating that it was built as the main entrance to the castle. The water-filled interior would have been crossed by a removable bridge, presenting an obstacle to attackers. From the bridge, access to the castle would have been up a flight of steps, into the triangular courtyard, and through the gate in the east curtain wall. It is possible that the hexagonal bastion was roofed to serve as an artillery position. Dredging of the reservoir in 1893 recovered two brass guns, referred to as \"double hagbuts\", and measuring around 1 m (3 ft) long with a bore of around 25 millimetres (1 in). Also recovered was a yett, an iron gate, probably installed in the east door to the bastion, but now on display inside the castle.[73] At some point in the 17th century, this elaborate access was abandoned and a more convenient entrance opened in the south wall of the hornwork.[73] By 1714, Lewis Petit's drawing clearly shows that the castle was largely derelict, with only the house at the southeast corner being roofed.[39] Four years later, it was completely demolished, and, by 1912, very little of the castle was still standing.[66]\nModern castle\nThe present castle buildings are entirely the result of 20th-century reconstruction by Macrae-Gilstrap, who commissioned Edinburgh architect George Mackie Watson to draw up the plans.[74][75] Although the rebuilding followed the extant ground plan, the details of the present castle differ from its original appearance. The survey drawings by Lewis Petit were not rediscovered until the restoration was almost complete, and the restorers therefore were forced to rely on less accurate interpretations such as the work of MacGibbon and Ross, who attempted a plan of the remains in the late 19th century.[76] The clerk of works, Farquhar Macrae, is said to have based the reconstruction on a dream in which he saw the restored Eilean Donan.[2] Rather than a genuinely medieval castle, Eilean Donan is described as \"a romantic reincarnation in the tradition of early 20th-century castle revivals.\"[77] John Gifford, analysing the building against the Petit survey, notes a \"fussy elaboration of what was probably plain originally, and an omission of decoration where it once existed\",[78] and describes the interior as \"a rubbly Edwardian stage-set for life in the Middle Ages\".[78]\nThe castle is today entered from the south, via a modern portal complete with a portcullis. Above the door is a Gaelic inscription which in translation reads: \"As long as there is a Macrae inside, there will never be a Fraser outside\", referring to a bond of kinship between the two clans, and a similar inscription which once adorned the Fraser's home at Beaufort Castle.[79] Above this is carved the coat of arms of John Macrae-Gilstrap. The portal gives access to the courtyard, the level of which has been lowered exposing the bedrock around the tower house. The present buildings at the southeast of the castle reflect the form of the earlier structures, including the circular stair tower, but are larger in extent.[80] To the southwest only the southern portion of the L-shaped block was reconstructed, as a plain three-storey house, while in place of the northern wing is an open platform giving views over the loch.[81] A small tower occupies the north-west angle. The keep itself follows the original dimensions, though the formerly subdivided ground floor is now a single room: the tunnel-vaulted Billeting Hall. Above on the first floor is the Banqueting Hall with an oak ceiling, and decorated with coats of arms and 15th-century style fireplace. The main ceiling beams in the Banqueting Hall are of Douglas Fir and were shipped from British Columbia, Canada as a gift from the Macraes of Canada.[82] Small mural chambers within the walls are accessed from each hall.[66]\nGallery Panorama of the castle from the south The castle, seen from the west Looking down the bridge to the castle View from inside the castle grounds Castle Eilen Donan - painting by William Daniell - 1818\nSee also\nList of islands of Scotland\nReferences\nCitations\nGeneral bibliography\nBrichan, James, ed.

It is recorded by contemporary evidence that Uilleam III, Earl of Ross granted a charter to Robert de Munro of Foulis for the lands of \"Estirfowlys\" with the \"Tower of Strathskehech\" from 1350.[2] It is also recorded that Euphemia I, Countess of Ross granted two charters to Robert's son, Hugh Munro, 9th Baron of Foulis in 1394. One of them dated 4 May 1394 is in respect of the \"Wesstir Fowlys\" and the \"Tower of Strathschech\", named so because of the River Sgitheach that passes through nearby Strath Skiach and into the Cromarty Firth.[2]\nA document signed and sealed at Foulis Castle in 1491 reads in Gaelic \"caisteal biorach, nead na h-iolair\", which means \"castle gaunt-peaked, the eagle's nest\".[2] This is in allusion to the clan chief's heraldic emblem.[2]\nIn 1542 Donald Mackay of Strathnaver, chief of the Clan Mackay was imprisoned in Foulis Castle, when he was captured after the Battle of Alltan-Beath.[3] According to Fraser's Wardlaw manuscript which was written in the 17th century, because of the Munro's kindness and civility towards Donald Mackay \"to this day\" a correspondence was linked between the Munros and Mackays.[4]\nThe castles \"tower and fortalice\" are also mentioned in a charter from the crown in 1587.[2] In times of clan warfare, a signal beacon was lit on the highest tower of Foulis Castle to gather the clan under arms, hence the Munro slogan or gathering cry of \"Caisteal Foghlais na theine,\" meaning Castle Foulis ablaze.\nThe castle survived up to the 18th century until it was attacked by Jacobites in 1746.[2] Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet was killed at the Battle of Falkirk Muir in 1746 and the castle was sacked and burned by the Jacobites in the same year.[1]\nSir Robert Munro's son the next successive chief, Sir Harry Munro, 7th Baronet returned home from captivity to find the castle had been set on fire and much of the castle had been destroyed. The Jacobites were defeated just a few months later by Government forces at the Battle of Culloden. Sir Harry Munro set about rebuilding the castle incorporating what he could of the original building. However as the Battle of Culloden had brought a complete end to the Highland clan system there was no need for such a defensive fort anymore. As with many castles at this time it was re-built as a large classical mansion between 1754 and 1792 as it appears today.[1] Foulis Castle still remains the home of the Chief of Munro, Hector W Munro of Foulis. However the most recent baronets of Foulis-Obsdale have lived in Southern England.[1]\nRestoration\nSome of the original castle fortifications showing under later walled construction\nNo records survive of what the fortifications at Castle Foulis looked like before 1746. Some evidence was discovered in the 1746 restoration. It is thought that the castle was surrounded by a series of smaller dwellings, of possibly a fortified nature. They found in 1957–59 evidence to suggest that in the courtyard area horses and cattle were kept, and that it was a self-contained community able to withstand a siege when attacked.\nThe Tower was a fortification, as its walls at the ground level are five feet six inches thick. In May 1985, while repairs were being carried out in part to the Courtyard building, Four \"cannon loops of an inverted key hole type,\" dating from the early part of the 16th century, were discovered behind four wedge-shaped, blocked-up apertures facing north, south, east and west in the wall. Above them is a barrel-vaulted stone ceiling.[2]\nThis building, at one time separate from the Castle, had certainly been constructed as a small defensive fort with an all-round \"field of fire\" to guard against possible attack.\nAt some later date, perhaps after 1746 and when the Chief felt that the chances of attack had lessened, the use of this building had changed. Three of the apertures had been completely blocked while the fourth had been partially blocked, leaving a narrow slit six inches wide and three feet long, into which a three-quarter-inch iron bar was strongly built, giving light, some air and access through which food could be passed to the unfortunate prisoner. It was likely the castle's gaol. According to Munro sources, some of the stone wall of the original castle was found under the plaster of the current main mansion house building at Foulis.\nSee also\nCastles in Scotland\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Foulis Castle Seat of the Clan Munro\". clanmunro.org.uk.\n\"Scottish Castles Photo Library, Foulis Castle, Ross and Cromarty\". rampantscotland.com.\n\"Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland - Foulis Castle\". electricscotland.com.\n57°38′42″N 4°21′55″W / 57.64500°N 4.36528°W / 57.64500; -4.36528\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

The site of two battles, the castle remains largely unchanged since its construction. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.\nHistory\nInverlochy Castle was built circa 1270–1280 by John \"the Black\" Comyn, Lord of Badenoch and Lochaber, and chief of the Clan Comyn. It may have been built on the site of an earlier Pictish fortification and settlement, which the historian Hector Boece (1465–1536) records as a \"city\" that was destroyed by Vikings.[1] After Robert the Bruce succeeded to the Scottish throne in 1306, he captured and burned the castle the following year.[2] The Comyns were thus dispossessed, and the ruined castle was unoccupied for a time.[1] In 1431, clansmen of Alexander MacDonald, Lord of the Isles, defeated King James I's larger army in the first Battle of Inverlochy, fought close by the castle. It came under control of the Clan Cameron until 1501.\nIn 1505, the partially ruined castle was granted to Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly, who was charged by King James IV with repairing the castle for use as a Royal garrison.[1] His brother William Gordon, Laird of Gight, became master of Inverlochy, and was slain commanding the Camerons at Flodden. In 1645, the castle served as a stopping-off point for the royalist army of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose during his campaign against the Covenanter forces of the Marquess of Argyll. This culminated in a victory for the royalists in the second Battle of Inverlochy, on 2 February 1645. In the 19th century, the estate was bought by James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger, who built a Scottish baronial style mansion to the north-west, which is now the Inverlochy Castle Hotel. Minor enhancements, including the restoration of loops and battlements, were carried out by Lord Abinger in advance of the visit of Queen Victoria in 1873.\nDescription\nInverlochy is now a ruin, but is unusual because it has remained unaltered since it was built in the reign of King Alexander III. The castle is sited on the south bank of the River Lochy, at the strategically important entrance to the Great Glen, a key passage through the Scottish Highlands. With one side defended by the river, the castle's other three sides were originally protected by a water-filled ditch.[1] Inverlochy is a castle of enceinte, with its main defence being a substantial curtain wall. The simple layout comprises a quadrangular courtyard, 31 by 27 metres (102 by 89 ft) across, surrounded by a wall up to 2.7 metres (8.9 ft) thick and up to 7.6 metres (25 ft) high, with round towers at each corner.[3] The largest of these, known as the Comyn Tower, is 6.1 metres (20 ft) across the interior, and served as the castle's \"donjon\", or keep. The smaller towers are 14 feet (4.3 m), and all four have stairways curving up within the thickness of the walls.[3] The main entrance was to the south, with a \"water gate\" facing the river to the north.[1] Both entrances were defended by a portcullis, and the south door may have had an interior gatehouse.[3]\nThe ruined castle is now a scheduled monument.[4]\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Inverlochy Castle.\nInverlochy Castle at Historic Environment Scotland\nwww.inverlochycastle.co.uk\nLewis, John; Smith, Helen (1998). \"Excavations at Inverlochy Castle, Inverness-shire, 1983-95\" (PDF).

    "text": "Castle in Inverness, Highland, Scotland, UK\nInverness Castle\nInverness Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Caisteal Inbhir Nis) sits on a cliff overlooking the River Ness in Inverness, Scotland. A succession of castles have stood on this site since 1057, although the present structure dates from 1836. The present structure is a Category A listed building.[1]\nHistory\nMedieval history\nA succession of castles have stood on this site since 1057.[2] The castle is said to have been built by Malcolm III of Scotland (Máel Coluim mac Donnchada). The first chief of Clan Mackintosh, Shaw Macduff is said to have been appointed constable of Inverness Castle by Malcolm IV in 1163 after assisting the king in putting down a rebellion in Moray.[3] The first Inverness Castle was partially destroyed by King Robert I of Scotland in 1307 who razed its battlements to the ground.[4]\nIn 1428, James I, in his effort to bring the Highlanders to heel, summoned fifty clan chiefs to a parley at Inverness Castle. However, \"where the Parliament was at the time sitting, they were one by one by order of the King arrested, ironed, and imprisoned in different apartments and debarred from having any communications with each other or with their followers.\"[5] Several chiefs were executed on the spot. Among those arrested were Alexander, 3rd Lord of the Isles, and his mother, Mariota, Countess of Ross. Lord Alexander remained imprisoned for twelve months, after which he returned to Inverness with 10,000 men and burnt the town, though he failed to take the Castle.[6]\nThe castle was occupied during the Raid on Ross in 1491. Walter Ogilvy was paid in February 1498 for repairing the two \"gemmel\" towers of Inverness Castle. A \"gemmel\" is a pair.[7] In February 1509 James IV made Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly hereditary keeper of the castle and sheriff of Inverness.[8]\nMary, Queen of Scots\nHistoric view of Inverness Castle\nIn 1548 another castle with tower was completed by George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly (1514–1562). Huntly had been obliged to build a hall and chapel at the castle by James V and Margaret Tudor in connection with his marriage to Elizabeth Keith in 1530.[9] Huntly was constable of the castle until 1562. Mary of Guise, Regent of Scotland, came to Inverness in August 1556 to hold justice courts.[10] The castle was later taken by the Clan Munro and Clan Fraser, who supported Mary Queen of Scots during the Siege of Inverness (1562). Robert Mor Munro, 15th Baron of Foulis, chief of the Clan Munro, was a staunch supporter and faithful friend of Mary Queen of Scots and was consequently treated favourably by her son James VI.[11]\nMary, Queen of Scots came to Inverness in September 1562. She travelled from Aberdeen. She crossed the River Spey at Boharm by ferry boat. The boat cost 40 shillings and her almoner gave money to the poor folk in Boharm.[12] There was a wayside Hospital dedicated to St Nicholas at Boat o'Brig in Boharm,[13] a Spey crossing where there had formerly been a wooden bridge.[14]\nGeorge Buchanan states that when the unfortunate queen found the gates of Inverness Castle shut against her, \"as soon as they heard of their sovereign's danger, a great number of the most eminent Scots poured in around her, especially the Frasers and Munros, who were esteemed the most valiant of the clans inhabiting those countries in the north\". These two clans took Inverness Castle for the Queen, who had refused her admission. The Queen later hanged the governor, a Gordon who had refused entry.[15] George Buchanan's original writings state:[16]\nAudito Principis periculo magna Priscorum Scotorum multitudo partim excita partim sua sponte afferit, imprimis Fraserie et Munoroii hominum fortissimorum in illis gentibus familiae.\nwhich translates in English as:\nThat when they heard of their Sovereign's danger a great multitude of the ancient Scots poured in around her of their own volition, especially the Frasers and Munros, who were esteemed the most valiant families among those clans.\nWhile Mary, Queen of Scots was in Inverness she bought gunpowder and 15 tartan plaids for her lackeys and members of her household.[17] Mary moved on to Speyside escorted by \"captains of the Highland men\", whose service cost £313-6s-8d Scots.[18]\nOther sieges of Inverness Castle\nThere were later sieges of Inverness in 1562, 1649, 1650, 1689, 1715 and 1746.[19] Mary, Queen of Scots and Lord Darnley appointed Hucheon Rose of Kilravock keeper of the castle in September 1565. In October it was decided, the Earl of Huntly should be keeper.[20]\nIn May 1619 it was reported that Inverness Castle was in a poor state, and \"a great part thereof was quite fallen down\". King James wrote from Theobalds to the Earl of Mar and Gideon Murray with orders that the castle should be repaired as soon as priority works at Linlithgow Palace and Dumbarton Castle were completed. James thought that \"although it may be that we in our own time shall never see it, much less dwell therein, yet may some of our successors take occasion to remain there\". The castle was not repaired at this time.[21]\nCurrent structure\nThe current structure was built on the site of the original castle.[22] The red sandstone structure, displaying an early castellated style, is the work of a few 19th-century architects. The main (southern), which incorporated the old County Buildings including the Sheriff Court, was designed by William Burn (1789–1870) in an early castellated, built in red sandstone and completed in 1836. The north block, which was originally used as a prison and later used as an additional courthouse, was designed by Thomas Brown II (1806–c. 1872) in a similar style, also built in red sandstone and was completed in 1848. Meanwhile, Joseph Mitchell (1803–1883) designed the bastioned enclosing walls.[23] The design of the main building involved a symmetrical main frontage of seven bays facing south. The central section of three bays, which slightly projected forward, involved a round headed doorway flanked by round headed windows on the ground floor, three round headed windows on the first floor and a battlement above. The outer bays took the form of castellated towers, the left-hand tower being round and the right-hand tower being square.[1]\nIn 1920, the castle frontage was adorned by four field guns, a field gun captured by the 5th Battalion Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders at the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915, a Bronze field piece captured by the 7th Battalion Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders at an unknown battle in France, and a pair of Russian field guns captured after the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War of 1855, which were gifted to Inverness after the Treaty of Paris in 1857. In 1941, to assist with the war effort during the Second World War, the Russian guns were sold off to Williamson & Co., a scrap dealer from Elgin, for £25. However due to an error, the 7th Battalion gun was taken away instead of one of the Sevastopol guns, and was scrapped before anyone became aware of the error, with the compensation for it going into the Comfort for the Camerons fund, and the remaining Sevastopol gun returning to the front of the castle,[24] before being moved inside the castle until the second courtroom was built in the 1970s.[25] As of 2017, only the gun from the Battle of Loos survives and is on display at the Clan Cameron Museum in Achnacarry.[26] Following the implementation of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, which established county councils in every county, the new county leaders needed to identify a meeting place for Inverness-shire County Council[27] and duly arranged to meet in the courthouse.[28] After Inverness-shire County Council moved to its new headquarters in Glenurquhart Road in 1963, the building continued to serve a judicial function, being used for hearings of the sheriff's court and, on one day a month, for hearings of the justice of the peace court. However, hearings of the Inverness Sheriff Court were moved to the Inverness Justice Centre on 30 March 2020.[29][30]\nDue to extensive renovation and remodelling the castle and grounds were closed to the public in 2021. The site is scheduled to re-open to the public in 2025.[31]\n£50 note\nAn illustration of the castle has featured on the reverse side of a £50 note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland, which was introduced in 2005.[32]\nGallery Pipe band at Inverness Castle, 2014 Inverness Castle in winter with the statue of Flora MacDonald in the foreground Inverness Castle Inverness Castle as seen from across River Ness.\nSee also\nBanknotes of Scotland (featured on design)\nSonnencroft\nNorth Coast 500, a scenic route which starts and ends at the castle\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Inverness Castle.\nHistory of Inverness Castle at Am Balie Archived 26 May 2011 at the Wayback Machine\nInverness Castle, Scotland\nPanoramic virtual tour of castle, gardens & view\n57°28′35″N 4°13′32″W / 57.47631°N 4.22550°W / 57.47631; -4.22550\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

It is surrounded by sea cliffs and the landward approach was separated by two moats. Only the square tower remains, originally four storeys tall, however only three storeys remain. The ground floor contained the kitchen and storage areas; the first floor was the hall with a southeast entrance. The upper floors contained the personal quarters of the lord of the castle.\nA narrow courtyard led to the centre of the peninsula with buildings on both sides, such as the barracks, the brewery, the chapel, etc. Outside the second moat was a defensive wall, which also formed the back wall of a number of buildings.\nThe castle was reached from the mainland via a drawbridge, which spanned a wide ditch cut into the rock, protected by a gatehouse and a defensive wall.\nHistory\nThe history remains obscure. It was originally thought to have been constructed in the 12th century, by Harald Maddadson, Jarl of Caithness and Orkney. However, the surviving structure seems to date to the 14th century.[2] Reginald le Chen of Inverugie and Duffus, is known to have been in possession of the castle in the early 14th century.[1] It passed by marriage of his daughter Mary to Nicholas Sutherland in 1345.\nThe castle later passed by the marriage of Christian, the daughter and heiress of Alexander Sutherland of Duffus, to William Oliphant in the 15th century.[1] Andrew Oliphant of Berrideale sold the property to his uncle, Lord Oliphant in 1526. Laurence Oliphant, Lord Oliphant and his servants were besieged and attacked by the John Sinclair, Master of Caithness in July 1569.[3]\nIt came to the Sinclair family in 1644, before passing to John Campbell, Lord Glenorchy, after the death of George Sinclair, Earl of Caithness, without issue. Lord Glenorchy, sold it to the Dunbars of Hempriggs in 1690. The Dunbars owned the castle until 1910.\nReferences\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

It controlled a prominent position overlooking the Moray Firth and critical to the sea access to Inverness.\nOrigins\nThe castle dates from the late 12th century and was rebuilt as a strong rectangular fortress with square corner towers (in the Norman style) between 1200 and 1214 by William the Lion as a royal fortress.[1]\nDe Moravia\nBy the thirteenth century, the castle was in the hands of the de Moravias of Petty and was where they ruled their vast tracts of land across Moray. Andrew de Moravia mustered the men of Moray to join King John Balliol at Ormond Castle following his dishonour in front of Edward I of England, at the outset of Wars of Scottish Independence.\nSir Andrew Murray died here in 1338.\nDouglas\nThe heiress to the de Moravias of Petty was Joanna of Bothwell, in 1362 she married Archibald the Grim, Lord of Galloway and later 3rd Earl of Douglas who claimed her estates and titles de jure uxoris (by right of marriage). Ormond Castle was the caput of the Barony of Ormonde, and was created into an Earldom in 1445 for Hugh Douglas, Earl of Ormonde, third son of James Douglas, 7th Earl of Douglas. Following the fall of the Black Douglases after the Battle of Arkinholm in 1455 and the execution of the earl, his properties, like those of his brothers, was forfeit. Ormond Castle was taken by the crown and regranted to George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus. Angus, the \"Red Douglas\", was a kinsman and enemy of the Black Douglases, and became the new power from that mighty house.\nThe title of Earl of Ormonde was recreated for the elder son of the 1st Marquess of Douglas in 1651, but became extinct upon the death of Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Ormonde in 1715, who died of wounds following the Battle of Sheriffmuir.\nMunro\nFrom 1560 to 1568 the castle was owned by David Chalmers, Lord Ormond, but his support of Mary Queen of Scots forced him into exile in 1568 and he was forced to sell the castle and the adjacent estates of Suddie and Avoch.[2]\nIn 1568 Ormond Castle and the lands of Suddie in Avoch were acquired under feu from the Earls of Angus and Ormonde, by Andrew Munro, 5th of Milntown, also known as Andrew Munro of Newmore during his father's lifetime.[3]\nCromwell\nOrmond Castle was destroyed in the 1650s by Oliver Cromwell, in order for him to build his fortress at Inverness.

    "text": "Ruins of Rait Castle in winter\nRait Castle is a ruined hall-house castle dating from the thirteenth century, situated just south of Nairn near Inverness, Scotland.[3] It is a scheduled monument.[4]\nArchitecture\nThe remains of the courtyard walls are nine feet high and also contain the remains of the Chapel of St Mary of Rait.[5] The building was a two story building, measuring 20 metres by 10 metres.[6] It had an unvaulted basement and an upper hall.[6] The hall was entered from the outside and was protected by a portcullis and a drawbar.[6] The walls of the castle are nearly 6 feet thick.[2] A tower projects from one corner of the castle and there is a garderobe tower on the west side that projects nearly 13 feet.[2]\nHistory\nThe castle was originally a property of the Comyn family, who took the name of de Rait.[1] Sir Alexander Rait killed the third Thane of Cawdor (chief of Clan Calder), and then fled south where he married the heiress of Hallgreen.[3] The castle later passed from the de Raits to the Mackintosh family and then to the Campbell family.[3]\nIn 1442,[1] when the castle passed to the Mackintoshes from the de Rait family, a feast was held at the castle between the two families which ended in the slaughter of most of the Comyns and de Raits.[7] The laird blamed his daughter, whom he chased around the castle.[7] She climbed out of a window but he chopped off her hands and she fell to her death.[7] The castle is said to be haunted by her ghost,[7] with no hands.[1]\nThe Duke of Cumberland is said to have stayed at the castle before the Battle of Culloden in 1746,[3] although the last recorded reference to the castle was in 1596.[2]\nAmerican singer Bonnie Raitt is a descendant of the Rait clan, and visited Rait Castle in 1990.[8]\nReferences\nExternal links\nStand Up for Rait Castle![usurped] saveraitcastle.org\nRait Castle canmore.rcahms.gov.uk.

    "text": "Former Scottish castle and Bishop's Palace\nScrabster Castle[a] was a castle, near Burnside, about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) north and west of Thurso, and 0.5 miles (0.8 km) south of the village of Scrabster, Highland in Scotland, south of Thurso Bay.[1] It is on an eroding promontory.[2]\nHistory\nBuilt by the Bishops of Caithness, the castle served as the Bishop's Palace for the bishops of Caithness. Bishop John of Caithness was mutilated by Harald Maddadsson, Mormaer of Caithness, in 1201,[3] after being besieged at the castle, having his tongue and eyes removed for John's refusal to collect Peter's Pence, a tax of 1/10 of the income of every freeman. George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness, seized the castle in 1544.[4] The castle was later a royal castle.[1] The castle was in ruins in the early 18th century.[2]\nStructure\nScrabster Castle was a castle of enclosure, with a keep. There is a pillbox within the ruins.[1]\nThere was a drawbridge towards the land. While erosion has partly destroyed the curtain wall, with other parts obscured by turf banks, short stretches of the outer face are exposed. The inner wall-face of a building about 5 metres (16 ft) square with a mural chamber is visible.[2]\nNotes\nCitations\nReferences\nCoventry, Martin (2010). Castles of the Clans.

    "text": "Ruined castle in Loch Moidart, Scotland\nNot to be confused with Eilean Tioram.\nCastle Tioram (/ˈtʃiːrəm/; Scottish Gaelic: Caisteal Tioram, meaning \"dry castle\") is a ruined castle that sits on the tidal island Eilean Tioram in Loch Moidart, Lochaber, Highland, Scotland. It is located west of Acharacle, approximately 80 km (50 mi) from Fort William. Though hidden from the sea, the castle controls access to Loch Shiel. It is also known to the locals as \"Dorlin Castle\". The castle is a scheduled monument.[3]\nHistory\nCastle Tioram was one of Somerled's castles in his time (the 12th century),[4] though some may date it from the 13th or 14th century.[5] It appears to have originally been a principal stronghold of Clann Ruaidhrí.[6] Eilean Tioram, the island the fortress sits upon, is first recorded in a charter of Cairistíona Nic Ruaidhrí, daughter of Ailéan mac Ruaidhrí.[7] According to early modern tradition, preserved by the 17th-century Sleat History, the castle was erected by Ailéan's granddaughter, Áine Nic Ruaidhrí.[8] The castle certainly served as the seat of the latter's Clann Raghnaill descendants for centuries.[9]\nAs such, Castle Tioram is the traditional seat of the Clanranald (Clann Raghnaill) branch of Clan Donald. The castle was seized by Government forces in around 1692 when the clan chief Allan Macdonald of Clanranald joined the Jacobite Court in France, despite having sworn allegiance to William III of England (II of Scotland) and Mary II of England (and Scotland). A small garrison was stationed in the castle until the Jacobite rising of 1715 when Allan recaptured and torched it, purportedly to keep it out of the hands of Hanoverian forces. It has been unoccupied since that time, although there are some accounts suggesting it was partially inhabited thereafter including for the storage of firearms from the De Tuillay in the 1745 Jacobite uprising and Lady Grange's account of her kidnapping.\nRestoration proposals\nProposals to restore the castle by the new owners, Anta Estates, were announced in 1997 and received planning consent from Highland Council. This included the creation of a clan centre/museum, domestic apartments, and some public access. However, Historic Scotland refused Scheduled Monument Consent, a decision upheld after a local public inquiry.[10][11]\nThe Council issued a Dangerous Buildings Order closing the castle to the public in 1998 due to its poor condition. The main structure was found to be \"inherently strong\" but a report concluded \"that without major consolidation work the risk of further collapse in five to 10 years was significant\".[12] A significant collapse, comprising several square metres of the outer layer of the north-west curtain wall, occurred in 2000 and was repaired by the owners. A condition report in September 2014 found that there had been no significant change in the stonework since then.[13] The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, now part of Historic Environment Scotland, holds a substantial archive of research information, drawings, and photographs lodged by the current owners.\nEilean Tioram\nThe castle can be reached on foot across the tidal causeway, but there is no access to the interior because of the risk of falling masonry. Eilean Tioram is one of 17 tidal islands that can be walked to from the Scottish mainland.[14]\nIn popular culture\nThe castle can be seen in an opening aerial montage of the Highlander: The Series fourth season episode, \"Homeland\".\nSee also\nScottish islands portal\nList of islands of Scotland\nCastles in Scotland\nMedieval fortification\nNotes\nReferences\nBoardman, S (2006).

    "text": "Engraving of Tor Castle, as found in Invernessiana: Contributions toward A History of the Town and Parish of Inverness, from 1160 to 1599 by Charles Fraser-Mackintosh, published in 1875\nTor Castle is a ruined castle, about 3 miles (5 kilometres) north east of Fort William, Highland, Scotland, west of the River Lochy and east of the Caledonian Canal, near Torlundy.[1]\nHistory\nAn Iron Age fort previously occupied the site. According to tradition, the fort once belonged to Banquo, the Thane of Lochaber, who features in the play Macbeth.[2] The Ordnance Survey Name Books of Kilmallie in 1872 makes an interesting comment of the site: \"The old Castle of Tor-Castle is by the natives of the place Tigh Bhanco i.e. ‘Banquo’s house’. There is a walk by the Lochyside to the North of Tor Castle known as Sràid Bhanco, i.e. ‘Banquo’s Walk’; and the small green field close by the Castle is called Dail a’ Chait i.e. ‘The field of the Cats’ where Banquo is said to have gone through a mode of ‘Divination’ by means of placing a cat on an iron spit & torturing the Taing of the Cats’ – a powerful spirit, who came forward, and on condition of getting his subject released revealed the future to the questioner.\" The site was erroneously styled ‘Togarma’ by Sir Walter Scott in a note to the Lady of the Lake. The correct designation is Tigh-ghairm nan Cat; i.e. ‘The House of Invocation of the Cats.[3][4]\nThere has been a castle at the site since at least the eleventh century. Donald B. MacCulloch (1939) writes in his book, Romantic Lochaber, that Tor Castle was built on top of an earlier site in the 11th century by Gillicattan Mor, early chief of Clan Chattan.[5] By 1291 a splendid match was arranged for Angus Mackintosh, chief of the Clan Mackintosh, when he married Eva, the only daughter of Dougal Dal, 6th chief of the Clan Chattan, which brought Angus the lands of Glen Loy and Loch Arkaig.[6] Angus and Eva lived on the lands of Clan Chattan at Tor Castle but they later withdrew to Rothiemurchus.[6] The reason for the withdrawal was apparently a dispute with Aonghus Óg of Islay, chief of Clan Donald, who was Angus's maternal uncle.[7]\nMacCulloch (1939) then writes that the lands around Tor Castle were given by John, the 1st Lord of the Isles, to Alastair Carrach (1380-1440), progenitor of the Keppoch branch of the Macdonalds, who built an early keep. Alastair Carrach later was given Lordship of the Isles and the Camerons, as his vassals at the time, did not object to Alastair residing there. During the Battle of Inverlochy, Alastair gathered forces and launched a attack with Donald Balloch against King James I forces.[8][9]\nThis battle also changed the allegiances of Clan Cameron and Clan Chattan, who were now loyal to the King instead of the Lord of the Isles.[10] The castle was then seized by Clan Cameron, who built a massive tower house and courtyard.[2] The Camerons initially used the castle as a refuge from attacks by the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch.[2] A feud therefore arose as Clan Cameron considered the lands and castle abandoned by Clan Mackintosh/Chattan.[11] By 1528, the old Clan Chattan lands at Lochaber were legally ceded to the Camerons, in a land charter by King James V.[5] Ewen Mor Cameron of Lochiel, 13th chief of Clan Cameron rebuilt the castle in 1530.[12] By 1665, Scotland’s Privy Council ordered the chief’s of Cameron and Mackintosh to appear before them and finally resolve the dispute and make both of them bound by its decision. The Council ordered Cameron to pay Mackintosh 72,000 merks. Mackintosh did not appear satisfied with this outcome and was arrested and bound to keep the peace. As soon as he was released, he called on the Chattan Confederation to launch an expedition into Lochaber. See Stand-off at the Fords of Arkaig. After the stand off, the Cameron Chief crossed the river to meet his former enemy at the House of Clunes and to sign a contract for the formal sale of Loch Arkaig and Glen Loy, with Cameron and six friends paying in three instalments over two years. The Camerons considered it something of a Pyrrhic victory, as the pursuit of their claim to Glen Loy and Arkaig over the years had cost them lands worth four times as much. Cameron had problems raising the money, and was offered a loan by the Earl of Atholl in an attempt to curb the power of the Earl of Argyll, but Argyll offered a similar loan at lower interest. However, there were strings attached, Cameron had to pay £100 Scots in feu-duty and to acknowledge Argyll as superior of the lands. The Camerons were still paying rent to Argyll's factor in 1749. Tor Castle remained the seat of Clan Cameron until a new residence at Achnacarry was built after 1665. Tor Castle appears finally abandoned after the Jacobite rising of 1745.[5]\nStructure\nThe castle consists of a very ruinous tower house.[2][13]\nThe Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS) site record of 1961 describes the site as \"Tor Castle, a tower house in a rather poor condition, measuring internally 8,2 m by 4,9m, with walls standing to a maximum height of 4,0m and averaging 2,2m in thickness. It is constructed of mortared random rubble and shows some evidence of repair or rebuilding. On the north side of the tower are two fragments of old walling, probably the remains of a former barmkin, and the old scrapings and platforms of the earlier Tor Castle can still be traced. A deep ditch, now water filled, isolates the site from the remainder of the ridge on which it stands.” A archeology survey of 2015 describes the site as \"Tor Castle (SM5471), survives predominantly as two prominent standing walls and a number of smaller sections of built wall, some of which are now turf covered.\"[14]\nLegal Status\nTor Castle is listed with National Record of the Historic Environment as 23706 and registered as a Scheduled Monument (SM5471)[15][16]\nReferencing\nExternal links\n\"Drawing of Tor Castle\". lochiel.net.\n56°51′39″N 5°03′54″W / 56.8609°N 5.0651°W / 56.8609; -5.0651\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle that sits beside Loch Ness\nUrquhart Castle (/ˈɜːrkərt/ ⓘ UR-kərt; Scottish Gaelic: Caisteal na Sròine) is a ruined castle that sits beside Loch Ness in the Highlands of Scotland. The castle is on the A82 road, 21 kilometres (13 mi) southwest of Inverness and two kilometres (1+1⁄4 miles) east of Drumnadrochit.\nThe present ruins date from the 13th to the 16th centuries, though built on the site of an early medieval fortification. Founded in the 13th century, Urquhart played a role in the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century. It was subsequently held as a royal castle and was raided on several occasions by the MacDonald Earls of Ross. The castle was granted to the Clan Grant in 1509, though conflict with the MacDonalds continued. Despite a series of further raids the castle was strengthened, only to be largely abandoned by the middle of the 17th century. Urquhart was partially destroyed in 1692 to prevent its use by Jacobite forces, and subsequently decayed. In the 20th century, it was placed in state care as a scheduled monument and opened to the public: it is now one of the most-visited castles in Scotland and received 547,518 visitors in 2019.[1][2]\nThe castle, situated on a headland overlooking Loch Ness, is one of the largest in Scotland in area.[3] It was approached from the west and defended by a ditch and drawbridge. The buildings of the castle were laid out around two main enclosures on the shore. The northern enclosure or Nether Bailey includes most of the more intact structures, including the gatehouse, and the five-story Grant Tower at the north end of the castle. The southern enclosure or Upper Bailey, sited on higher ground, comprises the scant remains of earlier buildings.\nHistory\nEarly Middle Ages\nThe name Urquhart derives from the 7th-century form Airdchartdan, itself a mix of the Old Irish aird (point or promontory) and Old Welsh cardden (thicket or wood).[4] Pieces of vitrified stone, subjected to intense heat and characteristic of early medieval fortification, had been discovered at Urquhart from the early 20th century.[5] Speculation that Urquhart may have been the fortress of Bridei son of Maelchon, king of the northern Picts, led Professor Leslie Alcock to undertake excavations in 1983. Adomnán's Life of Columba records that St. Columba visited Bridei some time between 562 and 586, though little geographical detail is given.[5] Adomnán also relates that during the visit, Columba converted a Pictish nobleman named Emchath, who was on his deathbed, his son Virolec, and their household, at a place called Airdchartdan.[6] The excavations, supported by radiocarbon dating,[7][8] indicated that the rocky knoll at the south-west corner of the castle had been the site of an extensive fort between the 5th and 11th centuries.[9] The findings led Professor Alcock to conclude that Urquhart is most likely to have been the site of Emchath's residence, rather than that of Bridei who is more likely to have been based at Inverness, either at the site of the castle or at Craig Phadrig to the west.[10][11]\nThe early castle\nSome sources state that William the Lion had a royal castle at Urquhart in the 12th century,[12][13] though Professor Alcock finds no evidence for this.[14] In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Meic Uilleim (MacWilliams), descendants of Malcolm III, staged a series of rebellions against David I and his successors. The last of these rebellions was put down in 1229, and to maintain order Alexander II granted Urquhart to his Hostarius (usher or door-ward), Thomas de Lundin. On de Lundin's death a few years later it passed to his son Alan Durward.[15] It is considered likely that the original castle was built soon after this time, centred on the motte at the south-west of the site.[14] In 1275, after Alan's death, the king granted Urquhart to John II Comyn, Lord of Badenoch.[15]\nThe view of the loch from a window in the west wall of the castle keep.\nThe first documentary record of Urquhart Castle occurs in 1296 when it was captured by Edward I of England.[14] Edward's invasion marked the beginning of the Wars of Scottish Independence, which would go on intermittently until 1357. Edward appointed Sir William Fitz Warin as constable to hold the castle for the English. In 1297 he was ambushed by Sir Andrew de Moray while returning from Inverness, and Moray subsequently laid siege to the castle, launching an unsuccessful night attack.[16] The English must have been dislodged soon after, since in 1298 Urquhart was again controlled by the Scots. In 1303 Sir Alexander de Forbes failed to hold off another English assault.[17] This time Edward installed as governor Alexander Comyn, brother of John, as the family had sided with the English against Robert Bruce. Following his murder of the Red Comyn in 1306, Bruce completed his defeat of the Comyns when he marched through the Great Glen in 1307, taking the castles of Inverlochy, Urquhart and Inverness.[18] After this time Urquhart became a royal castle, held for the crown by a series of constables.[19]\nThe remains of the 13th-century \"shell keep\" or motte is the earliest part of the castle to survive\nSir Robert Lauder of Quarrelwood was constable of Urquhart Castle in 1329. After fighting at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, where the Scots were defeated, Lauder returned to hold Urquhart against another threatened English invasion. It is recorded as being one of only five castles in Scotland held by the Scots at this time (the others were Dumbarton, Lochleven, Kildrummy and Loch Doon).[19] In 1342, David II spent the summer hunting at Urquhart, the only king to have stayed here.[19]\nOver the next two hundred years, the Great Glen was raided frequently by the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, powerful rulers of a semi-independent kingdom in western Scotland, with a valid claim to the earldom of Ross. In 1395, Domhnall of Islay seized Urquhart Castle from the crown, and managed to retain it for more than 15 years. His brother, Alexander Macdonald, Lord of Lochaber, also had a contract from Thomas Dunbar, Earl of Moray, to defend the Regality of Moray, which included access to the Great Glen. In 1411, Donald Macdonald marched through the glen on his way to claim the earldom of Ross. He met Alexander Stewart, earl of Mar at the Battle of Harlaw. Donald won the battle and retained control of Ross thereafter.[20] James I recognized his title as the first earl of Ross of his family. Nevertheless, the crown was soon back in control of Urquhart.[21][22] In 1437 Domhnall's son Alexander, Earl of Ross, raided around Glen Urquhart but could not take the castle. Royal funds were granted to shore up the castle's defences. Alexander's son John succeeded his father in 1449, aged 16. In 1452 he too led a raid up the Great Glen, seizing Urquhart, and subsequently obtained a grant of the lands and castle of Urquhart for life. However, in 1462 John made an agreement with Edward IV of England against the Scottish King James III. When this became known to James in 1476, John was stripped of his titles, and Urquhart was turned over to an ally, the Earl of Huntly.[21][22]\nThe Grants\nThe Grant Tower viewed from Loch Ness\nHuntly brought in Sir Duncan Grant of Freuchie to restore order to the area around Urquhart Castle. His son John Grant of Freuchie (d.1538) was given a five-year lease of the Glen Urquhart estate in 1502. In 1509, Urquhart Castle, along with the estates of Glen Urquhart and Glenmoriston,[23] was granted by James IV to John Grant in perpetuity, on condition that he repair and rebuild the castle.[24] The Grants maintained their ownership of the castle until 1512, although the raids from the west continued. In 1513, following the disaster of Flodden, Sir Donald MacDonald of Lochalsh attempted to gain from the disarray in Scotland by claiming the Lordship of the Isles and occupying Urquhart Castle. Grant regained the castle before 1517, but not before the MacDonalds had driven off 300 cattle and 1,000 sheep, as well as looting the castle of provisions.[25] Grant unsuccessfully attempted to claim damages from MacDonald.[26] James Grant of Freuchie (d.1553) succeeded his father, and in 1544 became involved with Huntly and Clan Fraser in a feud with the Macdonalds of Clanranald, which culminated in the Battle of the Shirts. In retaliation, the MacDonalds and their allies the Camerons attacked and captured Urquhart in 1545.[26] Known as the \"Great Raid\", this time the MacDonalds succeeded in taking 2,000 cattle, as well as hundreds of other animals, and stripped the castle of its furniture, cannon, and even the gates.[27][28] Grant regained the castle, and was also awarded Cameron lands as recompense.[26]\nThe Great Raid proved to be the last raid. In 1527, the historian Hector Boece wrote of the \"rewinous wallis\" of Urquhart,[25] but by the close of the 16th century Urquhart had been rebuilt by the Grants, now a powerful force in the Highlands. Repairs and remodelling continued as late as 1623, although the castle was no longer a favoured residence. In 1644 a mob of Covenanters (Presbyterian agitators) broke into the castle when Lady Mary Grant was staying, robbing her and turning her out for her adherence to Episcopalianism. An inventory taken in 1647 shows the castle virtually empty.[29] When Oliver Cromwell invaded Scotland in 1650, he disregarded Urquhart in favour of building forts at either end of the Great Glen.[29]\nBroken masonry from the destruction of the gatehouse\nWhen James VII was deposed in the Revolution of 1688, Ludovic Grant of Freuchie sided with William of Orange and garrisoned the castle with 200 of his own soldiers. Though lacking weapons they were well-provisioned and, when a force of 500 Jacobites (supporters of the exiled James) laid siege, the garrison was able to hold out until after the defeat of the main Jacobite force at Cromdale in May 1690. When the soldiers finally left they blew up the gatehouse to prevent the reoccupation of the castle by the Jacobites. Large blocks of collapsed masonry are still visible beside the remains of the gatehouse.[29] Parliament ordered £2,000 compensation to be paid to Grant, but no repairs were undertaken.[30] Subsequent plundering of the stonework and other materials for re-use by locals further reduced the ruins, and the Grant Tower partially collapsed following a storm in 1715.[31]\nLater history\nBy the 1770s the castle was roofless and was regarded as a romantic ruin by 19th-century painters and visitors to the Highlands.[32] In 1884 the castle came under the control of Caroline, Dowager Countess of Seafield, widow of the 7th Earl of Seafield, on the death of her son the 8th Earl. On Lady Seafield's death in 1911 her will instructed that Urquhart Castle be entrusted into state care, and in October 1913 responsibility for the castle's upkeep was transferred to the Commissioners of His Majesty's Works and Public Buildings.[33] Historic Environment Scotland (formerly Historic Scotland), the successor to the Office of Works, continues to maintain the castle, which is scheduled monument in recognition of its national significance.[2]\nIn 1994 Historic Scotland proposed the construction of a new visitor centre and car park to alleviate the problems of parking on the main A82 road. Strong local opposition led to a public inquiry, which approved the proposals in 1998.[34] The new building is sunk into the embankment below the road, with provision for parking on the roof of the structure.[35] The visitor centre includes a display of the history of the site, including a series of replicas from the medieval period; a cinema; a restaurant; and a shop. The castle is open all year, and can also host wedding ceremonies.[36] In 2018 518,195 people visited Urquhart Castle, making it Historic Scotland's third most visited site after the castles of Edinburgh and Stirling.[37]\nDescription\nKey: A Site of drawbridgeB GatehouseC Nether Bailey or Outer CloseD Chapel E Inner CloseF Grant TowerG Great HallH KitchenI Water gateJ Upper Bailey or Service CloseK Motte and shell keepL DoocotM SmithyN Loch Ness Plan of Urquhart Castle\nUrquhart Castle is sited on Strone Point, a triangular promontory on the north-western shore of Loch Ness, and commands the route along this side of the Great Glen as well as the entrance to Glen Urquhart.[38] The castle is quite close to water level, though there are low cliffs along the northeast sides of the promontory. There is considerable room for muster on the inland side, where a \"castle-toun\" of service buildings would originally have stood, as well as gardens and orchards in the 17th century.[3] Beyond this area the ground rises steeply to the north-west, up to the visitor centre and the A82. A dry moat, 30 metres (98 ft) across at its widest, defends the landward approach, possibly excavated in the early Middle Ages. A stone-built causeway provides access, with a drawbridge formerly crossing the gap at the centre.[38] The castle side of the causeway was formerly walled-in, forming an enclosed space similar to a barbican.[39]\nUrquhart is one of the largest castles in Scotland in area.[3] The walled portion of the castle is shaped roughly like a figure-8 aligned northeast-southwest along the bank of the loch, around 150 by 46 metres (492 by 151 ft),[40][13] forming two baileys (enclosures): the Nether Bailey to the north, and the Upper Bailey to the south.[41][42] The curtain walls of both enclosures date largely to the 14th century, though much augmented by later building, particularly to the north where most of the remaining structures are located.[30]\nPanorama of the Urquhart Castle\nNether Bailey\nThe remains of the gatehouse\nThe 16th-century gatehouse is on the inland side of the Nether Bailey and comprises twin D-plan towers flanking an arched entrance passage. Formerly the passage was defended by a portcullis and a double set of doors, with guard rooms on either side. Over the entrance are a series of rooms which may have served as accommodation for the castle's keeper.[30] Collapsed masonry surrounds the gatehouse, dating from its destruction after 1690.[39]\nThe Nether Bailey, the main focus of activity in the castle since around 1400,[43] is anchored at its northern tip by the Grant Tower, the main tower house or keep. The tower measures 12 by 11 metres (39 by 36 ft), and has walls up to three metres (10 ft) thick.[44] The tower rests on 14th-century foundations, but is largely the result of 16th-century rebuilding.[45] Originally of five storeys, it remains the tallest portion of the castle despite the southern wall collapsing in a storm in the early 18th century. The standing parts of the parapet, remodelled in the 1620s,[45] show that the corners of the tower were topped by corbelled bartizans (turrets).[44] Above the main door on the west, and the postern to the east, are machicolations, narrow slots through which objects could be dropped on attackers. The western door is also protected by its own ditch and drawbridge,[45] accessed from a cobbled \"Inner Close\" separated from the main bailey by a gate.[46] The surviving interior sections can still be accessed via the circular staircase built into the east wall of the tower. The interior would have comprised a hall on the first floor, with rooms on another two floors above, and attic chambers in the turrets. Rooms on the main floors have large 16th-century windows, though with small pistol holes below to allow for defence.[45]\nTo the south of the tower is a range of buildings built against the thick, buttressed, 14th-century curtain wall. The great hall occupied the central part of this range, with the lord's private apartments of great chamber and solar in the block to the north, and kitchens to the south.[47] The foundations of a rectangular building stand on a rocky mound within the Nether Bailey, tentatively identified as a chapel.[48]\nUpper Bailey\nThe Upper Bailey is focused on the rocky mound at the southwest corner of the castle. The highest part of the headland, this mound is the site of the earliest defences at Urquhart. Vitrified material, characteristic of early medieval fortification, was discovered on the slopes of the mound, indicating the site of the early medieval fortification identified by Professor Alcock. In the 13th century, the mound became the motte of the original castle built by the Durwards, and the surviving walls represent a \"shell keep\" (a hollow enclosure) of this date. These ruins are fragmentary but indicate that there were towers to the north and south of the shell keep.[49]\nA 16th-century watergate in the eastern wall of the Upper Bailey gives access to the shore of the loch.[28] The adjacent buildings may have housed the stables.[50] To the south of this, opposite the motte, is the base of a doocot (pigeon house) and the scant remains of 13th-century buildings, possibly once a great hall but more recently re-used as a smithy.[49][51]\nView from the motte showing the location of the drawbridge, with the remains of the gatehouse on the rightThe Nether Bailey, showing the gatehouse (left), Grant Tower, hall range (right), and the foundation of the chapel in the centreView from the Grant Tower, with the hall range in the foreground and the shell keep at the upper right\nRelics\nRing brooch, 14th- or 15th-Century, found at Urquhart Castle.[52]\nAfter the castle came into public hands repairs and excavations were carried out. These were interrupted by World War I but were resumed and completed by 1922. A large collection of relics was found, including a bronze ewer from the 15th century, coins, jewellery, crosses and other items from the 13th to 17th centuries. The excavations have been criticised for not recording the locations or stratigraphic information, but the collection is of great value, and is now mostly in the care of the National Museum, Edinburgh.[53][54] Samson (1983) has provided a detailed list with illustrations.[54]\nReferences\nBibliography\nAlcock, Leslie; Alcock, Elizabeth A.

    "text": "Castle in Scotland\nCastle Varrich\nCastle Varrich\nCastle Varrich (Scottish Gaelic: Caisteal Bharraich) is a castle in the far north of the Scottish Highlands, near the village of Tongue. The castle is on a local high point of rock, overlooking both the Kyle of Tongue and the village of Tongue. The castle's precise origins and age are unknown.\nThe ancient seat of the chief of the Clan Mackay was at Castle Varrich, thought to be over one thousand years old; there are believed to be caves under the castle which were once inhabited by the Mackays. It is believed[who?] that the Mackays may have built their castle on the site in the 14th century, on top of an existing old Norse fort.\nThe walls are generally 1.4 metres (5 ft) thick, or thicker, and have been built from roughly squared blocks of metamorphosed sandstone rock of varying thickness, laid in rough courses of random depth. The stones seem to have been laid without the use of mortar, and have suffered little from weathering, considering that the building may be 1000 years old, and considering the local weather. From places where parts of the walls have fallen away it appears that the construction seen on the wall faces is consistent throughout their thickness; as distinct from the type of walling where the faces have been constructed in a tidy fashion, but between them is a core of rubble.\nThe castle had two floors plus an attic. The ground floor may have been used as stables; it was entered through an existing door on the north wall. There were no stairs between the two floors, suggesting that the ground floor was for horses or cattle. The upper floor entrance was on the south side and would most likely have been accessed by a ladder or removable stair. There was a window in the east wall and a fireplace in the west, but both have now collapsed past recognition. Later the clan chief's seat moved to Tongue House. There is a marked footpath from Tongue to Varrich Castle.[1][2]\nVarrich Castle has views of mountains Ben Loyal and Ben Hope.[3]\nThe castle was updated in 2017 to make it more accessible with a galvanised steel spiral staircase and viewing platform inside allowing visitors a higher viewpoint over the Kyle of Tongue.[4]\nReferences\nExternal links\nPhotos of Castle Varrich on Flickr: [1],[2],[3]\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Castle Varrich.\n58°28′32.72″N 4°26′7.58″W / 58.4757556°N 4.4354389°W / 58.4757556; -4.4354389\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "name": "Duchal Castle",
    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchal_Castle",
    "text": "The ruins of the large courtyard style Duchal Castle lie circa 1.5 miles south-west of Kilmacolm in the Inverclyde council area and the historic county of Renfrewshire in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. The castle stands at the bottom of the valley of the River Gryfe on a peninsula created by the Blacketty and Green Waters which have their confluence beyond the two deep gorges.[1]\nHistory\nThe gorge of the Burnbank Burn.\nThe castle was held from the 12th century by the Lyle, L'Isle, Lyell or Insula family. It seems unlikely that they were of the same Lisle family which had first settled in Northumberland.[2] Ralph de Insula of Duchal is recorded in the reign of Alexander II (1198 – 1249) and he may have built the first castle here. In the mid 15th century Lord Lyle was ennobled by James II and a successor, Sir Robert Lyle became Lord Chief Justice and a Privy Councillor to James III.[3] Lord Lyle had died in 1470 and his heiress had married Alexander Lyle of Craigbate.[4] In 1513 James IV and his natural son James (see below), Archbishop of St Andrews, both died at the Battle of Flodden.[3]\nThe title of Lord Lyle passed to the descendants of Sir Neil Montgomerie of Lainshaw near Stewarton who had married Jean, daughter of the 4th Lord Lyle.[4]\nEvidence of the old feudal baronial court is to be found in the place name 'Moothill' located near East Green in John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland, 1832.[5] The name 'Duchal' is often written as 'Duchall' on old maps, etc.\nSiege and later history\nA section of the curtain wall on the Green Water side.\nRobert Lyle, 2nd Lord Lyle fought against the king at the Battle of Sauchieburn in 1488 and in 1489 he supported the Lennox rebellion resulting in James IV besieging Duchal, which had been garrisoned by the Earl of Lennox in 1488, local tradition holding that Mons Meg was used as had been the case at Crookston Castle and Dumbarton Castle.[3] A second cannon was also employed and this became known as 'Duchal'.[6] The king himself attended the siege at some point and nine Dutch pirates are known to have volunteered as an alternative to hanging.[7] The sheriffs had to provide oxen to haul the guns to Duchal and the king obtained at Paisley who came to the castle with mattocks and spades. The siege only lasted a few days.[8]\nThe lands of Duchal were forfeited, the castle was repaired and held for a time by Robert Cunningham, 2nd Lord Kilmaurs and later 2nd Earl of Glencairn,[6] however Sir Robert managed to return to the king's favour and even became Lord Chief Justice for a second time in 1492.\nIn 1544 Duchal Castle passed to the John Porterfield of Porterfield by purchase on the death of John de Lyle, 3rd Lord Lyle.[6][3][9] Jean Knox of Ranfurly, retired to their old seat of Porterfield in 1575 upon her husband's death and subsequently the family used the property as a dower house.[6] Duchal passed to Lord Melfort by Crown grant however it was returned to the Porterfields of that Ilk.[10]\nIn 1578 Duchal was attacked and burnt as part of a family feud by James Cunningham, Master of Glencairn (later the 7th Earl of Glencairn), attacked and burnt down Duchal Castle as part of a feud between the Cunninghams and the Porterfields.[6] The damage appears to have been repaired as the castle remained in use for some time afterwards.\nDuchal Castle in 1701 is recorded as partly ruinous and Catherine Boyd, wife of Alexander Porterfield is said to have built Duchal House as his wife, daughter of the Earl of Kilmarnock, regarded the old castle in its wooded location to be cold, damp and unsuited to comfortable living.[6] Duchal had been reduced to a substantial ruin by 1782 however the castle's draw well (slop shute or garderobe) and drawbridge survived.[6]\nThe castle gradually declined in importance until the family started afresh at the site of 'New Duchal'. A substantial number of human bones are recorded to have been found in an upper apartment during the dismantling of the now abandoned fortifications.[3] A summerhouse was built on the River Gryfe using stones recycled from the old fortifications[6] and the remains of a rectangular building between the inner and outer bailey may be the remains of this building.[11]\nMarion Boyd and Alexander Stewart\nJames IV kept and often visited one of his mistresses, Marion Boyd of Bonshaw at Duchal, having a son, Alexander Stewart with her, born in 1497 at the castle.[3] On a visit here from Glasgow on 22 February 1497 the king commanded that money be left for Marion and his baby son giving eighteen shillings \"to the noris that fosterit Marioun Boydis barne and fourteen to a harper.\"[10] She later married John Mure of Rowallan Castle. The King celebrated his twenty-fifth birthday at Duchal on 17 March 1498 and enacted a Deed or Revocation here.[12]\nDescription\nThe well/slop shute/garderobe/postern gate from the Green Water Gorge.\nThe castle's curtain walls follow much of the edge of the raised peninsula with its continuous precipitous and mainly vertical drop into the rivulets on either side. The courtyard is fairly level and was divided into an inner and outer bailey. At the western end of the site a deep ditch crossed by a drawbridge with a gatehouse helped defend the ground level access off what is now a narrow country lane, some traces of this ditch survive. On the north-eastern side is a prominent stone lined well (take care if visiting), slop shoot or garderobe gives access to the Burnbank Burn gorge and shows evidence of having been reduced in size as some stage for defensive reasons (See photograph). This feature may have once been a postern gate with steps down. Two or possibly three 16th century wide-mouthed gun loops can still be seen in the courtyard wall.[3] The thickness of these curtain walls suggests a 13th-century date.[13]\nOn the south-eastern side, overlooking the deep Blacketty Burn gorge, is a rocky outcrop that stands circa 20 ft above the courtyard floor with visible masonry foundations and this was the site of the keep, possibly a later structure of 14th or 15th century date, however too little remains to validate this.[13] The main entrance and gatehouse was at the north-western angle and two postern gates also existed, one at the northern end that was accessed via steps from the courtyard and the other at the eastern end leading to the end of the peninsula. At the north-west are the likely remains of a window associated with a lean to structure.[4] The name 'Duchal' imay translate as 'Two Rivers'.\nThe Covenant\nThe Porterfields were supporters of the Covenanters and eventually suffered by forfeiture and imprisonment in 1684, the laird becoming known as Melfort's Martyr. Lord Melfort had pursued the case against the Porterfields with great vigour and he was granted the family estates which he held for a short time before they were returned and he fled the country.[10] Before 'Duchal' was arrested and tried an incident took place where two of Melfort's spies came to Duchal and pretended to be fellow Covenanters in need of food and shelter which they were duly given, however Lady Duchal suspected them and had them watched, upon which it was observed that they did not say grace before eating. Lady Duchal informed her husband who had them seized, bound and severely whipped before placing them in an old vault where they lay until an officer collected them.[14]\nDuchal House\nDuchal House was built to the east of the castle (NS353680) by the Porterfields in 1710 and as was the custom much of the carved stone, etc. was robbed and used in the new building. Duchal House is still occupied and despite various additions the present structure may incorporate part of the 1710 building.[3][6]\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\nCoventry, Martin (2010).

It was the seat of the Dukes of Buccleuch from 1642 until 1914, and is owned by the Buccleuch Living Heritage Trust. The present palace was built 1701–1711 on the site of the medieval Dalkeith Castle, and was latterly renamed Dalkeith House.\nHistory\nDalkeith Palace in 1880\nDalkeith Palace by John Preston Neale, 1829\nThe medieval castle\nDalkeith Castle was located to the north east of Dalkeith and dated from the 12th century when it was in the possession of the Clan Graham, Lords of Dalkeith. With the death of John de Graham in 1341–1342 the castle and the barony of Dalkeith passed to the Clan Douglas via his sister, Marjory, who was married to Sir William Douglas. James Douglas of Dalkeith became the Earl of Morton in the mid 15th century. The castle was strategically located in an easily defensible position above a bend in the River North Esk. Nearer the centre of Dalkeith, James Douglas, 1st Lord Dalkeith, endowed the collegiate church in 1406, where Douglas earls, lords, and knights were buried.\nMargaret Tudor, the bride of King James IV, stayed at Dalkeith Castle as the guest of the Earl of Morton before her formal entry to Edinburgh in 1503.[1] In 1543, Cardinal Beaton was imprisoned in Dalkeith Castle. The castle was captured on 3 June 1548 during the war of the Rough Wooing by the English soldiers James Wilford and Thomas Wyndham, with the Spanish captain Pedro de Gamboa.[2]\nMary, Queen of Scots, rode from Edinburgh to stay a few days at Dalkeith in October 1565.[3] From June 1574, Regent Morton, who had been captured at the siege of 1548, extended the castle.[4] Sir John Forster, an English border warden captured at the Raid of the Redeswire, was held in the palace in July 1575.[5]\nJames VI and Charles I\nWhen King James VI reached his majority in October 1579, following celebrations in Edinburgh, Morton entertained the young king at Dalkeith Castle.[6]\nJames VI and Anne of Denmark frequently stayed at the castle. While they were in residence in August 1592, a prisoner John Wemyss of Logie escaped through their bedchamber, helped by the queen's servant, Margaret Vinstarr.[7] In 1598 the royal master of work William Schaw prepared a nursery for the queen at Dalkeith Castle and Princess Margaret was born there on Christmas Eve.[8]\nIn August 1601 the infant Prince Charles was seriously ill while staying at the castle, but recovered. During his illness, Anne of Denmark wrote a controversial letter to Cardinal Borghese.[9]\nWilliam, 6th Earl of Morton had the brewhouse, gates, and drawbridge repaired.[10] James VI visited the palace on 11 June 1617.[11] Andrew Simson presented a Latin poem celebrating the palace's grounds and describing the song of the Dalkeith nightingale.[12]\nWilliam, 7th Earl of Morton, Treasurer of Scotland, entertained King Charles I during his visit to Scotland in 1633. The king liked the place so much he considered buying the estate and turning it into a deer park. By 1637, Charles had decided to buy the castle and estate from Lord Morton. The castle was re-fortified and strengthened in order to prepare it for the king. Among other alterations, Charles I built an additional drawbridge and extra defences. With the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Charles I found it difficult to complete his purchase of Dalkeith, and the castle was eventually returned to the Earl of Morton.\nDalkeith Palace\nSerre Circulaire du Park de Dalkeith\nThe Conservatory\nIn 1642, Dalkeith Castle was sold by the Earl of Morton to Francis Scott, 2nd Earl of Buccleuch. The 2nd Earl of Buccleuch's daughter, Anne, married the James, Duke of Monmouth, eldest illegitimate son of King Charles II in 1663, and they became the Duke and Duchess of Monmouth and Buccleuch. After the Duke had been executed for treason, his widow asked architect James Smith to use William of Orange's palace of Het Loo in the Netherlands as a model for the new Dalkeith Palace.\nSmith and his cousins, Gilbert and James, signed the contract for mason work at Dalkeith Castle in March 1702. Construction of Dalkeith Palace began later that year, Smith deciding to incorporate a portion of the tower house of the old castle into the western side of the new structure. The outline of the old tower walls is still visible in the western facade of the palace today. In 1704, William Walker and Benjamin Robinson, the chamberlain of the Duchess, went to London with a small party to choose items of furniture for the palace. Construction was proceeding at a steady pace, and the main portion of the palace was roofed by the end of 1705. The London marble-cutter Richard Neale spent sixty-four weeks at the palace with nine assistants between 1709 and 1711, carving the main stairwell and screen of the Great Staircase. Several marble chimney pieces were installed, as well as an intricately carved marble bas-relief of Neptune and Galatea. This internally extensive use of marble was very much the taste of the Duchess. The majority of construction was complete by 1711.\nFinishing touches on the palace complex included adding a wrought iron screen with freestone piers (no longer existing) around the forecourt, a great deal of planting, and the laying out of a great avenue through the park. Dalkeith Park itself was a large area of manicured trees and gardens which in later years would include the Montagu Bridge over the North Esk River and the Dalkeith Conservatory and a grassed amphitheatre. When the final calculations were made, it was determined that the construction of Dalkeith Palace had cost the Duchess a total of £stg.17,727.\nThe plumber John Scott of Edinburgh re-plated the roof in lead in 1743. Some minor additions were carried out in the following years. John Adam resurfaced the building in 1762 and James Playfair inserted a low window into the east facade in 1786.\nOverall, the palace is built of sandstone and has the main entrance on the south front, flanked on each side by two Corinthian order pilasters. These are surmounted by a bracketed pediment unusual for its depth. The layout of Dalkeith Palace was unusual for the time in that the state apartment was located on the ground floor, which prevented the Great Dining Room from being placed in its customary position at the start of the state apartment. As such, the Great Dining Room was placed on the first floor, still suitable for important occasions and also serving as an anteroom to another apartment on the first floor.\n18th and 19th centuries\nThe 5th Duke of Buccleuch\nThe 5th Duke of Buccleuch considered extensive rebuilding in 1831 and William Burn produced unexecuted designs in Jacobean style. More minor alterations were carried out, together with improvements to the surrounding estate including a new house and offices for the Duke's Chamberlain, and the construction, for the 5th Duke, of St Mary's Church as a private chapel by William Burn and David Bryce. The church contains one of only two water-powered organs in Scotland.\nSeveral well-known figures from English and Scottish history have been guests at the palace in the intervening centuries. Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed two nights at Dalkeith in 1745, King George IV slept here during his visit to Edinburgh in 1822, in preference to the Palace of Holyroodhouse which was in a poor state, as did Queen Victoria in 1842. Dalkeith Palace was also visited by Edward VII in 1899 and 1903, and George V in 1907 and 1910. During World War II, Polish troops of the 3rd Flanders Rifle Brigade, part of the 1st Polish Armoured Division, were quartered on the third floor of Dalkeith Palace from 1942 onwards. Graffiti drawn by these troops is still visible on the third floor wallpaper of the palace as of 2008.\nSubsequent history\nView from northeast\nFront-view of Dalkeith House, 2011\nDalkeith Palace has not been lived in by the Buccleuch family since 1914, and in 1920 the palace gardens and glasshouses were let as market gardens. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Dalkeith Palace was used as a research and development office by the computer firm International Computers Ltd. (ICL), which leased the palace until 1983. From 1985 it was leased to the University of Wisconsin system for a study abroad programme. Approximately 60–80 students a semester lived in the palace, where they also took classes from UK and US faculty members. The University and Buccleuch Living Heritage Trust announced in July 2020 that the lease would end in January 2021.[13]\nSee also\nList of places in Midlothian\nEstate houses in Scotland\nFootnotes\nExternal links\nJohn Slezer's view of Dalkeith Castle, c.1690 digital image from National Library of Scotland\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Ruined castle in the Moray region of Scotland\nLocation\nExterior view\nInterior view\nBalvenie Castle is a ruined castle 1 km north of Dufftown in the Moray region of Scotland.\nHistory\nOriginally known as Mortlach, it was built in the 12th century by a branch of the powerful Comyn family (the Black Comyns) and was extended and altered in the 15th and 16th centuries.\nThe castle fell out of use following an attack by Robert the Bruce in 1308, which left the property uninhabitable. At some point in the 14th century, the castle and estates of Balvenie passed to the Earl of Douglas. Nothing is documented as to how the Black Douglases first acquired the castle but the most likely account is that it came with the marriage of the heiress Joanna Murray to Archibald 'the Grim' , 3rd Earl of Douglas in 1362. His son and successor Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas granted his younger brother James Douglas, 7th Earl of Douglas, latterly known as James 'the Gross' , the lordship of Balvenie in 1408. James's main residence was at Abercorn Castle, a coastal fortress to the west of Edinburgh and Balvenie Castle's use was as temporary accommodation when the need arose.\nIn 1440, William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas, was killed by James the Gross, probably in a conspiracy with William Crichton and Alexander Livingston of Callendar, the guardians of the then child-king James II. James 'the Gross then became the 7th earl. James immediately provided the lordship of Balvenie with its castle to his youngest son, John Douglas, Lord of Balvenie. Earl James's death in 1443 signalled a resumption of the hostility between the royal Stewarts and the Black Douglases. The Battle of Arkinholm in May 1455 saw the defeat of this, the main Douglas line by an army loyal to James II. All of their lands and titles were forfeited to the Crown, including Balvenie Castle. King James divided up the estates among his supporters, which included the Douglas Earl of Angus and provided Balvenie Castle to Sir John Stewart, who later became the first Earl of Atholl.\nWilliam Duff committed suicide in the castle in 1718 and it was effectively abandoned at that point. It was used by Hanoverian forces as an encampment in 1746 during the second Jacobite rebellion.[1]\nToday, the remains of the castle are managed by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.[2] However, ownership continues in private hands; the current owner is Jeremy Duncan Nicholson, Baron of Balvenie, who resides in Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. The castle is open to the public from the beginning of April to the end of September.\nBalvenie whisky is produced by William Grant & Sons at the Balvenie distillery down the hill from the castle.\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Balvenie Castle.\nHistoric Environment Scotland: Visitor guide\nTake a Virtual Tour Around Balvenie Castle\n57°27′10.55″N 3°07′26.40″W / 57.4529306°N 3.1240000°W / 57.4529306; -3.1240000\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Scotland\n\"Cullen Castle, Banffshire\", Pen and brown ink and grey wash over black chalk on paper, 35.60 x 51.00 cm. (Now in Moray)\nCullen Castle was a royal castle about 0.5 miles (0.8 km) west of Cullen, Moray, Scotland, west of the burn of Deskford, and south of Seatown. The remains have been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, accessible to the public.[1] This is not to be confused with Cullen House or Castle of Cullen of Buchan. There is also a ruin of a Cullen Castle in County Waterford, Ireland.\nHistory\nElizabeth de Burgh, the wife of Robert the Bruce died here, although it has been suggested this was at an earlier castle.[2] Vestiges of the castle remained until the 19th century.[3]\nStructure\nIt is believed that the castle, on Castle Hill, was a motte, encircled by a wide ditch and outer rampart, except on the north where a landslip has destroyed it. The ditch is about 6.0 metres (19.7 ft) wide and 1.75 metres (5 ft 9 in) deep; the outer bank is about 6.0 metres (19.7 ft) wide and 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) high.[4]\nThe mound of the motte has been covered by a network of ancient paths. Excavations were conducted in February–October 2017 to restore parts of the network and minimise erosion. Eight test pits were dug of which seven located the main path. The other one was dug in an area less disturbed by foot traffic and did not locate the path despite being excavated to a depth of 150 millimetres (5.9 in). Foundation bases for picnic tables and benches and a replacement flagpole socket were installed during the excavations. No finds or features of archaeological interest were found.[4]\nReferences\n57°41′25″N 2°49′32″W / 57.69036°N 2.8256°W / 57.69036; -2.8256\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Duffus Castle, near Elgin, Moray, Scotland, was a motte-and-bailey castle and was in use from c. 1140 to 1705. During its occupation it underwent many alterations. The most fundamental was the destruction of the original wooden structure and its replacement with one of stone. At the time of its establishment, it was one of the most secure fortifications in Scotland. At the death of the 2nd Lord Duffus in 1705, the castle had become totally unsuitable as a dwelling and so was abandoned.[1]\nThe wooden castle\nDepiction of typical motte-and-bailey castle\nOengus, Mormaer of Moray, led a rebellion against David I, King of Scots in 1130. After Oengus' defeat and death in battle, David installed Freskin, a nobleman probably of Flemish origin, as his chief agent in Moray,[2] and he was probably the first to build a castle at Duffus.\nFreskin’s background is uncertain. The consensus amongst historians is that he was of Flemish background, the principal argument being that \"Freskin\" is a Flemish name.[3] Undoubtedly, King David, himself a Scoto-Norman monarch with extensive estates in northern England and Normandy, granted lands to many nobles from Flanders as well as Normans. The unlikely alternatives are that he may have been an Anglo-Saxon or a Scot who fought for King David and his English general Edward Siwardsson in Moray. At that time, when Flemish nobles were referred to in writs by nationality (almost never), they were styled \"Flandrensis\".[4] Freskin appears in no contemporary sources, and was never referred to by his national origin. Regardless of his origin, by the 13th century his descendants were referring to themselves as 'de Moravia' ('of Moray') and had become one of the more powerful families in northern Scotland.[5]\nIt was Freskin who built the great earthwork and timber motte-and-bailey castle in c. 1140 on boggy ground in the Laich of Moray. It was certainly in existence by the time the king came to visit in 1151.[6] The motte was a man-made mound with steeply sloping sides and a wide and deep ditch that surrounded the base. Timber buildings would have stood on its flat top and would have been further protected by a wooden palisade placed around the edge of the summit. The motte was accessed from the bailey. This is a wide stretch of earth elevated above the surrounding area but not as high as the motte. At Duffus, the motte would have been reached by steps set into the mound. The bailey contained the buildings necessary to sustain its inhabitants – brew and bake houses, workshops and stables – as well as the living accommodation.\nThe castle may have been destroyed in 1297[7] during the First War of Scottish Independence,[8] and it might have suffered further during King Robert the Bruce's campaign in Moray in 1306.\nThe stone castle\nIn 1270, the castle passed into the ownership of Sir Reginald le Chen (d.1312) by marriage to the heiress Mary de Moravia, a descendant of Freskin. With the death of Reginald le Chen of Duffus in 1345, Duffus passed to his daughter Mariot who was married to Nicholas, the second son of Kenneth de Moravia, 4th Earl of Sutherland. The Sutherlands themselves were descended from Freskin and the castle remained in their possession until 1705[5] when it was abandoned.\nPlan of castle\nIn 1305, it was recorded that Reginald le Chen received a grant from King Edward I of England of 200 oaks from the royal forests of Longmorn and Darnaway \"to build his manor of Dufhous\",[9] demonstrating that a large construction project was being carried out. The wood could have been needed for scaffolding, flooring and roofing of a new stone fortress. Alternatively, the stone structure, which dates from the early 14th century,[7] could have been built by the younger Reginald.\nA two-storey rectangular tower was built on the motte and was the main residence. The first floor held the lord's hall, with a latrine and bed chambers. The ground floor was the main storage space and also accommodated the lord's household. The tower was built as a defensive structure with a small number of narrow windows. There was only one entrance on the ground floor, which also housed a portcullis. On the second floor, two doors exited onto the walkway of the curtain wall. This wall enclosed the bailey. The putlog holes built into the curtain wall indicate the presence of a number of buildings. On the north side, a later building was erected that housed a kitchen, a great hall with a reception room and the great chamber bedroom. It is possible that this building was constructed by the Sutherlands. It is not known when the serious subsidence took place but there is evidence of repairs to the tower before it slid down the motte. The tower shows no further repairs and may have collapsed early on, but the newer hall became the main residence. This building shows continued alterations over time. In 1689, John Graham, 1st Viscount of Dundee was a guest of Lord Duffus just before the Battle of Killiecrankie, and would be one of the last important visitors before the castle's abandonment.[10]\nNotes\n^ MacGibbon, D & Ross, T 1887 The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland, vol 1.

    "name": "Spynie Palace",
    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spynie_Palace",
    "text": "Ruined castle in Moray, Scotland, UK\nSpynie Palace, also known as Spynie Castle, was the fortified seat of the Bishops of Moray for about 500 years in Spynie, Moray, Scotland. The founding of the palace dates back to the late 12th century. It is situated about 500 m from the location of the first officially settled Cathedral Church of the Diocese of Moray, Holy Trinity Church in present-day Spynie Churchyard. For most of its occupied history, the castle was not described as a palace — this term first appeared in the Registry of Moray in a writ of 1524.[1]\nBackground\nThe beginnings of the Bishopric of Moray are unclear. The first mention of a bishop was Gregoir whose name appeared on several royal charters in the 1120s. The early bishops of Moray had no fixed abode but moved between houses at Birnie, Kinneddar and Spynie.[2] In 1172, King William I, the Lion, made grants to the church of the Holy Trinity of the Bishopric of Moray and Bishop Simon de Tosny. Formal permission for the permanent move to Spynie was given by Pope Innocent III to Bishop Bricius de Douglas in April 1206 and the transfer was probably made by 1208.[3] Bishop Bricius attended the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 and may have appealed to Innocent to transfer the See of Moray to Elgin. However, he certainly wrote to him requesting the move before July 1216.[4] The cathedral church of Spynie was considered vulnerable to attack and too far from the market. Elgin with its royal castle would have been seen as a better option. Bricius did not live to see the changes made, dying in 1222, but his successor, Bishop Andrew of Moray carried them out.[5] Although the See of Moray was transferred to the Church of the Holy Trinity in Elgin on 19 July 1224, the Bishop of Moray's episcopal palace remained at Spynie.[6]\nThe fortified residence\n12th and 13th centuries\nThe first castle was a wooden structure built in the late 12th century and was revealed in excavations carried out between 1986 and 1994.[7] The excavated evidence suggests that the buildings were surrounded by a rectangular ring work and ditch which seem to have enclosed an area of roughly the same as the 14th-century curtain wall, i.e., an enclosure of 45 – 65 m and is large even by medieval ring works found elsewhere in Britain. The buildings would likely have consisted of the bishop's house with a hall, a bed chamber and a chapel and also holding a brewhouse and a bakehouse.[6] The early living quarters The stone buildings first appeared in the 13th century with the establishment of what was thought to have been a chapel and which had coloured glass windows.[8]\nThe first recorded mention of the castle is in a document held in the British Museum. This manuscript dates from the early 14th century but appears to have been compiled between 1292 and 1296 and was apparently for the use of English administrators during King Edward I of England's occupation of Scotland.[9][10] The first writ issued at Spynie Castle was in 1343 and is recorded in the Register of Moray[11]\n14th and early 15th centuries\nThe remaining wooden buildings were gradually replaced with stone, and this continued through into the 14th century when the first main castle building was erected. This was a near-square structure built within a 7-metre-high curtain wall. The main entrance in the wall faced to the south and a tower that projected from the south-east corner had narrow openings for archers.\nIn this period Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, otherwise known as the Wolf of Badenoch, attacked and burned Elgin Cathedral in June 1390. It also appears that he took Spynie Castle as King Robert III (Buchan's brother) issued an instruction to Buchan in August 1390 forbidding him to 'intromit' the Castle of Spynie for any reason.[12] Following Bishop Alexander Bur's death in 1397, the King, in conformity with feudal established practice during the period of the vacant seat, took possession of the castle and perversely appointed the now reformed Wolf of Badenoch to be warden of the castle.[12] After the election of the new bishop, the King issued a writ on 3 May 1398 to Buchan to hand over the castle and contents to Bishop William without claiming expenses.[12]\nLater 15th and 16th centuries\nIt is thought that Bishop John de Winchester (1435–60) was responsible for moving the main gate to the east wall which contained a strong portcullis.[13] The architectural detail of the upper section of the gate remains and shows the gatekeeper's room complete with a small fireplace. John, as well as being the Bishop of Moray, was also the king's Master of Works and had been responsible for alterations to the castles at Inverness and Urquhart as well as the palace at Linlithgow.[14] The fine stonework and styling of the gate may have been carried out by the master masons working on the restoration work at Elgin Cathedral following its destruction in 1390.[15]\nDavid's Tower\nThe most significant buildings were established in the later 15th century through into the 16th century when David's Tower (also known as Davey's Tower) was built along with other substantial accommodation areas. The tower is the largest by volume of all medieval Scottish towers measuring 19 m by 13.5 m and 22 m in height and was started by Bishop David Stewart (1462–76) and completed by Bishop William Tulloch (1477–82).[16] It has 6 storeys above ground and had a garret on the top. Below ground is a vaulted basement which is approximately 1.5 m below the level of the courtyard; it contains a circular dungeon, 5.3 m in diameter, lit only by a narrow loop looking to the west and has a slightly domed vaulted roof.[17] The ground floor contained the hall which is 12.8 m by 6.7 m and lit by large windows with built-in stone seats.[17] At the NE corner was a spiral staircase which led to the upper floors. Each of these floors was similar in design with a single large room and smaller chambers leading off it. The tower is plain and practically lacking in architectural features; the external walls were originally rendered while the internal walls were plastered.[18]\nBishops David Stewart's and Patrick Hepburn's armorial shields below\nStewart was also responsible for converting the old hall in the west range to kitchens to service the tower. It was said that the building of the tower was a reaction to intimidation from the Earl of Huntly whom Stewart had excommunicated for failing to pay his taxes.[19] During the mid-16th century, a walled garden to the south of the castle precinct was established mainly to house an orchard. A deed was signed in the garden in 1556 indicating that it would have been a pleasant place to relax in.[20] The household diet was further supplemented when a rabbit warren and a doocot were added in 1569.[21] Bishop Patrick Hepburn (1538–73), the last Roman Catholic bishop at Spynie, installed wide-mouth gun loops to boost the castle defences and enlarged some windows.[22] He continued to live at Spynie for a period after the Reformation.\nEnglish prisoners were held at Spynie during the war known as the Rough Wooing, including Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley who was taken at Hume Castle in December 1548.[23] Christopher Rokeby, an agent provocateur of Elizabeth I of England, who had tried to lead Mary, Queen of Scots, into a plot with English Roman Catholics, was imprisoned in Spynie Castle in 1566 for eighteen months during Bishop Patrick Hepburn's tenure.[24] Hepburn fell foul of the Privy Council for sheltering his relative Bothwell at Spynie in 1567 who had fled from the battle of Carberry Hill first to Huntly Castle. Bothwell sailed to Orkney and Shetland, and finally to Denmark.[25][26]\nAs part of the pacification following the abdication of Queen Mary, Regent Morton, in a meeting of the Privy Council at Perth on 23 February 1573, ordered that the castle be made available to the Crown, if needed:the hous of Spyne salbe randerit and deliverit to oure Soverane Lord and his Regent foirsaid quhen it salbe requirite on XV dayis warning, without prejudice of ony partiis rycht.[27]\nOn 29 July 1587, King James VI gave the castle and estate to Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie; and they remained in his hands until he surrendered them back to the Crown in December 1605.[28] During this period in 1595, Spynie was one of the castles that had additional fortifications installed as protection against a perceived threat from the Spaniards.\n17th century\nIn 1606, King James restored to the bishopric of Moray the endowments that remained.[29] Bishop John Guthrie, who was a well-known royalist, ceased to be the bishop in 1638 when all bishops were deposed by the general assembly – he and his family continued to live at Spynie however. Guthrie refused to subscribe to the Covenant and prepared the castle for a siege which duly arrived in 1640 in the form of Covenanter Col. Sir Robert Monro and his 800 men.[30] Interior of David's Tower showing putlog holes for floors and plastered wallsGuthrie surrendered the castle immediately on 16 July and the castle was disarmed, however he was allowed, together with his wife and servants, to stay within the castle. Although under house arrest, Guthrie was forced to pay for the upkeep of the garrison of twenty-four men.[30] In September 1640, Guthrie was imprisoned in Aberdeen on rather dubious accusations. The castle was then granted to the Earl of Moray by King Charles I. Elgin and surrounding areas were staunchly anti-Royalist[31] and after his victory against the Covenanters at Auldearn on 9 May 1645, James Graham, Marquis of Montrose turned his attention towards Elgin. The Laird of Innes and Grant of Ballindalloch and some burgesses from Elgin prepared the castle for a siege.[32] Montrose occupied Elgin and burned the homes of leading Covenanter supporters in the town and the farmyard buildings belonging to Spynie but did not attempt to take the castle.[33] Spynie had become the centre for the Covenanters in the area and this fact had not gone unnoticed by the Royalists. The Marquis of Huntly laid siege to the castle in late 1645 leaving Lord Lewis Gordon in charge but the castle's defences held until it was relieved by John Middleton, the future Earl of Middleton.[34]\nFollowing the restoration of Episcopacy to the Scottish Church in 1662 ownership of the castle passed back to the church, but it was starting to fall into decay. Parliament granted Bishop Murdo MacKenzie £1000 for repairs and this sustained the building up to 1689[35] when the last occupant, Bishop William Hay was expelled after refusing to take an oath of allegiance to King William and Queen Mary.[36] The palace passed into the hands of the Crown and the fine ironwork and wood carvings removed. Local people plundered the walls for stonework for building works until the early 19th century when it passed into the ownership of James Dunbar-Brander of Pitgaveny. It was leased to the Department of the Works in 1974. The tower by that time had a pronounced bulge in the east wall - the structure being undermined by attempts by Covenanters to blow it up.\nMajor work to stabilise the structure was undertaken during the late 1970s using a large scaffold. Ultimately a curtain wall was reinstated disguising a large concrete plinth that prevents the tower from collapsing. The Palace was finally opened by Historic Scotland in 1994.[37]\nNotes\nMain references\nBuchanan, George: The History of Scotland, Vol III, 1856\nDonaldson, G: The Foundation of Elgin Cathedral, in Maclean, A 1974 (ed): Elgin Cathedral and Diocese of Moray, Inverness, p. 2\nFawcett, R: Elgin Cathedral, Edinburgh, 1991\nLewis, Pringle: Spynie Palace and the Bishops of Moray, Edinburgh, 2002\nMacGibbon; Ross: Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland, Edinburgh, 1887\nSimpson, W D: The Palace of the Bishops of Moray at Spynie, Elgin, 1927\nExternal links\nHistoric Environment Scotland. \"Spynie Palace (SM90282)\".\nMysterious Britain & Ireland: Spynie Palace\nMary, Queen of Scots website\nImages:\nBishop's Palace Ruins,[1],[2]\nBishop's Church:[3]\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Brodick, Arran, Scotland\nThe walled garden at Brodick Castle\nBrodick Castle is a castle situated outside the port of Brodick on the Isle of Arran, an island in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland. It was previously a seat of the Dukes of Hamilton, but is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland. The castle is a Category A listed building[1] and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.[2]\nHistory\nEarly and High Medieval\nA fortress has been on the site since at least the fifth century, when Gaelic invaders from Antrim expanded their kingdom of Dál Riata.\nBy the tenth century Norse influence had grown, and Arran formed part of Sudreys or Súðreyjar, administered either from Dublin or Orkney (Nordreys or Norðreyjar) and nominally under the control of the King of Norway. This can be deduced by the number of Scandinavian place-names on the island including Brodick, or Breiðvík (Broad Bay, also spelt variously Brethwic, Brathwik, Brethwik, Brathwic, Bradewik, and Braizay).[3] The site is thought to have been a centre of relative importance, on account of its strategic position on the Firth of Clyde.\nBy the mid-thirteenth century Arran was part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles ruled by two Gall Gaidheal kings, Magnus of Mann and Dougal of the Isles, sub-rulers of Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway. Alexander III of Scotland had inherited his father's desire to control the islands in order to stabilise his kingdom, and made numerous unsuccessful advances to that effect. In 1262 the Earl of Ross sacked and pillaged Skye with the king's blessing. King Hákon determined to avenge this slight and set out in July 1263, with a large fighting fleet (leiðangr) for Scotland. After linking up with the fleets of Magnus and Dougal, and showing his might throughout the Hebrides, Hákon's force anchored in Lamlash Bay[4] on Arran, where they were approached by envoys from the Scots King. The Scots envoys were unsuccessful, and battle was engaged at Largs, a short distance across the firth.\nAlthough no rout, the Scots were victorious, and Hákon's forces retreated to Arran, and thence to Orkney to over-winter, where Hákon died. The ensuing Treaty of Perth in 1266 ceded the Sudreys to the Kingdom of Scotland.\nInterregnum and Wars of Independence\nWhen both Alexander III and his heir, Margaret, Maid of Norway died, the Kingdom of Scotland was thrown into turmoil. In 1291, Edward I of England, was called on to choose the most suitable successor. John de Balliol was chosen and was forced to admit Edward as his suzerain. John defied Edward in 1295, and did not answer his request for assistance in his war in France. Edward invaded Scotland the following year and forced John to abdicate. At some point around this time an English garrison was stationed at Brodick.[5][6] During Robert the Bruces's time in hiding, following his escape from the English after his coronation and defeat at the Battle of Methven, he is said to have had his legendary encounter with a spider on Arran.\nOn the behest of Robert the Bruce, James Douglas, Lord of Douglas, early in the winter of 1306/07 previous to their attack on Carrick, attacked forces supplying Brodick castle giving a first minor victory and gaining their forces much needed supplies.\nActing with Sir Robert Boyd of Kilmarnock, Douglas was able in January 1307 to dislodge the English from Brodick, one of the first castles to fall to Bruce's forces in his struggle to regain his country.[7]\nLate Middle Ages\nThe arms of the Chief of Hamilton, showing the Lymphad of the Isles\nIn 1406 – the same year that James I was captured by English pirates and Robert III died – the castle was badly damaged by an English force that had sailed into Brodick bay. Further destruction was inflicted by John of Islay, Lord of the Isles, in 1455.[8] At some point after 1470 the castle was granted by James III to his brother-in-law, James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton. His son, James Hamilton, 2nd Lord Hamilton was created Earl of Arran in 1503. At this point Hamilton added the Lymphad of the Isles to his Armorial bearings\nThe Hamiltons\nEarls of Arran\nThe castle had been rebuilt by the Earl by 1510 in the form of a tower house, but suffered at the hands of the Campbells and the MacLeans. During the \"Rough Wooing\" of Mary, Queen of Scots, Brodick castle was attacked by an English force led by the Earl of Lennox on behalf of Henry VIII, in revenge for the actions of the 2nd Earl. Lord Arran was the Regent of Scotland whilst Mary was in her infancy, and was second in line to the Scots throne. In 1543, he had been heavily involved in arranging the marriage of Mary to the Dauphin of France, prior to this she had been promised to Edward, Prince of Wales. Arran was rewarded for his efforts, however, and was created Duke of Châtellerault in the Peerage of France. During Regent Arran's tenure at Brodick he continued to enlarge and expand the castle. In the summer of 1550 Andrew Hamilton and Dean John Slater worked on the building.[9] In March 1552 live partridges and hares were sent to Brodick for the Regent's table and a special boring tool called a \"wombill\" was bought to make holes at the rabbit warren. In June a carpenter Peter Moffett made new doors. Some timber spars for the new building were supplied by the Laird of Luss on Loch Lomond.[10]\nIn May 1579 the Earl of Argyll took Brodick for James VI and Ninian Stewart was installed as keeper for the crown.[11] In 1602 Paul Hamilton, captain of Brodick for Marquess of Hamilton, with his companions all armed with pistols attacked a farmer Marrarat MacMillan at North Sannox and took his horse and cattle, and wool and plaids and imprisoned Duncan MacElloway at Brodick.[12]\nDukes of Hamilton\nBrodick Castle did not escape the religious paroxysms that affected seventeenth century life (see the Wars of the Three Kingdoms). In 1639, Scotland was divided between the Presbyterianism of the Lords of the Congregation, and the Episcopalianism favoured by King Charles I. James Hamilton, 3rd marquess of Hamilton, the King's advisor on all things Scottish, was sent north to enforce the King's will, he had previously dissolved the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland when they had abolished the Episcopacy. Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, was the de facto ruler of Scotland and leader of the presbyterian faction. Argyll seized Hamilton's castle of Brodick. Hamilton was made a Duke in 1643 and recovered his castle the following year at the outbreak of the Scottish Civil War. It was lost again to the Campbells in 1646, as the Royalists fortunes foundered. The Duke was captured after the disastrous Battle of Preston, and faced the block in March 1649. He was succeeded by his brother William, Earl of Lanark, but the second Duke died of wounds received at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. The Duchy of Hamilton and Earldom of Arran passed to the first Duke's only surviving child, Anne. She had been unwittingly sent to Brodick for safety. In 1650, Oliver Cromwell's Roundheads had taken control of the castle and had extended it by building an Artillery battery to defend the Firth at this strategic position.\nDuchess Anne returned to her estates in Lanarkshire and West Lothian and in 1656 married William Douglas, 1st Earl of Selkirk. Anne did not return to Brodick, however her husband the newly created Duke of Hamilton for life, used the castle as a base for hunting excursions.\nIn the following years Brodick was used mainly as an occasional sporting estate. In the nineteenth century, it became residence for the eldest son of the 10th Duke, styled the Marquess of Douglas and Clydesdale.\nWilliam, 11th Duke of Hamilton, married in 1843, Princess Marie of Baden, youngest daughter of the Grand Duke of Baden and Stéphanie de Beauharnais, adopted daughter of Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1844, massive building work was undertaken at the castle, almost tripling the size of the building, under the architect James Gillespie Graham. The Twelfth Duke, William, had no male heirs, so although his titles passed to his distant cousin Alfred Douglas-Hamilton upon his death, he entailed the castle upon his only daughter the Lady Mary Louise Douglas-Hamilton. She married the 6th Duke of Montrose in 1906. Unlike in 1651, when the property also passed through the female line and the then spouse assumed the Hamilton name, at this time, after more than five hundred years, Brodick Castle was no longer possessed by someone bearing the Hamilton name.\nToday\nThe Castle and gardens were acquired by the National Trust for Scotland from the Lady Jean Fforde in 1958,[13] in lieu of death duties upon the death of her mother, the Dowager Duchess of Montrose. The 2017 obituary in The Times of London of Lady Jean (who, among other things, had worked at Bletchley Park, the principal centre of Allied code-breaking during the Second World War) quotes her as saying that the loss \"of the castle and all its contents . . . was like losing my whole life.\"[14]\nThe castle is open to the public during the summer, with Brodick Country Park open all year round. The site welcomed 68,423 visitors during 2019.[15]\nA black-and-white copy of William Woollett's engraving of the painting The Death of General Wolfe by Benjamin West can be seen at the castle.\nSince 1972, an illustration of the castle has featured on the reverse side of twenty pound notes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland.[16] The 1998 film The Governess, starring Minnie Driver, was filmed at Brodick Castle.\nGardens\nBee boles can be seen in the Walled Garden, which was built in 1710.[17]\nSee also\nBanknotes of Scotland (featured on design)\nHome Farm, Brodick\nReferences\nBibliography\nCoventry, Martin (2006), The Castles of Scotland, Birlinn, ISBN 1-84158-449-5\nFordun, John of.

    "text": "Barony in the former District of Cunninghame, now North Ayrshire\nThe Barony of Giffen and its associated 15th-century castle were in the parish of Beith in the former District of Cunninghame, now North Ayrshire. The site may be spelled Giffen or Giffin and lay within the Lordship of Giffin, which included the Baronies of Giffen, Trearne, Hessilhead, Broadstone, Roughwood and Ramshead; valued at £3,788 9s 10d.[2] The Barony of Giffen comprised a number of properties, including Greenhills, Thirdpart, Drumbuie, Nettlehirst and Balgray, covering about half of the parish of Beith.[3] Giffen was a hundred merk land, separated from the Barony of Beith, a forty-pound land, by the Powgree Burn which rises on Cuff hill.[4] The Lugton Water or the Bungle Burn running through Burnhouse may have been the Giffen barony boundary with that of the adjacent barony and lands of Aiket castle.\nGiffen has a recorded history that covers many familiar aspects of a feudal barony, including the possession of a moot hill or justice hill, here represented by 'Greenhills', as well as a thirled mill and a 'gathering place' known as the 'Borestone'. Other features such as the old chapel and the holy well add to the expected features, most of which no longer survive.\nEtymology\nGiffen is a Brittonic place name.[5] It is named either from *cemno, meaning \"ridge\" (c.f. Welsh cefn),[5] much like The Chevin in West Yorkshire, England,[5] or *cöfin, a word adopted from Latin[5] meaning \"a common/shared boundary\" (Welsh cyffin).[5]\nThe history of Giffen Castle\nThe 40-foot-high (12 m) tower castle of Giffen lay near to the existing Mains of Giffen site on the 180-foot-high (55 m) summit of a whinstone trap ridge at (NS 37727 50718). MacGibbon and Ross[6] suggest that Giffen Castle was built in the 15th century, although the 13th-century (1233)[7] land grant to Walter de Mulcaster, and the prior existence of a chapel, suggest that a defensive structure of some sort was present at that date. At the time of Pont's survey (J Dobie 1876), it was a tower 30 ft (9.1 m) square, 40 ft (12 m) high, with walls 6 ft (1.8 m) thick. It fell into disrepair soon after 1726 and finally collapsed in 1838. It has also been recorded as 'Griffen' on some old maps of the district.\nEtymology\nThe Anglo-Saxon name Giffin comes from 'Giff', a pet form of the personal name Geoffrey. This pet form is supplemented by the diminutive suffix -on or -in.\nThe castle was acquired by Sir John Anstruther in the early 18th century and he is responsible for allowing it to become a ruin, together with the associated Giffen farm. The sundial originally in the Giffen castle garden was sold and was moved eventually to Crummock house, Beith, now demolished. In 1959 the sundial was reported to be located at Craigbet, Renfrewshire.[8] This sundial had its horizontal plane divided by volutes, between which a lion's head alternates with a rose; it was made in 1719 and repaired in 1810.\nGeorge King of Giffen Mill was permitted by Robert Craig of Giffen Farm in 1726 to remove the stones he needed to build a dwelling house at the mill. The castle roof was taken off and the interior exposed to the elements.[9] Local farmhouses were built using stone from the front wall of the castle, which was consequently entirely removed. Above the entrance, with its strong iron door,[10] there had been a carving of a man shooting with a crossbow at what has been called a wild boar. It is not unlikely that this commemorates a feat of bold hunting by a member of the family of Giffen. A similar carving at Linton parish church commemorates just such a feat, for which William the Lion knighted the bowman and bestowed upon him the lands and barony of Linton.[1]\nFor some years after the roof was removed youths would climb the circular stairs and light a fire on the eve of the feast of St Ennan, the saint of the parish.[9] In 1837 the castle's south wall fell[11] and finally on 12 April 1838, during the silence of the night, the north and east walls of the old castle fell leaving little more than a disorderly heap of stones. The adjacent Mains of Giffen farm had been feued by Anstruther to Robert Craig in 1726. John King of 'Giffin Miln' built his house using stone from the castle and this is probably how the old carvings came to be incorporated into the walls of this building. The doorjambs are also said to have come from the old castle. Thomas Craig, grandson of Robert, passed on the feu to Thomas White in 1816, during whose possession the castle met its final fall, inspiring the following indignant poem by James Wilson, the local poet:\n\"Hard-hearted misers worship dust,\nTheir covetous mind is little worth,\nSecured in chains for mammon's curse,\nThe older they grow worse and worse!\"\nGiffen castle in the 1800s with what is probably the old Giffen Farm, just visible to the left-hand side[12]\nThe Giffen Craigs and Bank of Giffen from Burnhouse Manor Farm.\nIn August 1956 the OS reported that the remains of Giffen Castle now consist of three fragments of rubble masonry, the largest portion measuring 4.0 m long by 2.0 m thick and 1.9 m high. The remainder of the castle was demolished in about 1920 when the adjoining quarry was dug.\nIn June 1983 the OS visited the site again and stated that there are no remains of the castle in situ. The three fragments of masonry are in fact large tumbled blocks, and together with a mass of loose shaped stone, also from the castle, form a garden rockery. A marriage stone lintel above the doorway of the adjacent Mains house is inscribed RC MC 1758. This appears contemporaneous to the single-storey house and of doubtful association with the old castle.\nMr. Robert King, the farmer of the lands near Giffen castle, reported in the 1890s that when digging drains to the north-east of the castle he came across a large number of bones, which tradition says were there as a result of a battle fought by the lord of the castle, his retainers and an attacking party. The bones were in a hollow to the west of the castle, and between it and the high ground on which the castle and hamlet of Giffen stood.[13] Metal detectorists found a number of musket-balls in this area.\nGiffen House\nThe entrance to Giffen House\nGiffen House\nWilliam Patrick Esq. of Roughwood and Woodside, a descendant of the ancient family of the Ayrshire Patricks, purchased the mid-superiority[14] of Giffen from the Earl of Eglinton in 1855 and also acquired the dominum utile[14] of much of the barony. In 1861 his grandnephew, Henry Gardiner Patrick, son of John Shedden Patrick of Trearne and Woodside, succeeded to the property and built a large and handsome mansion-house in the Scottish Baronial style on the lands of Bankhead farm, a little over two miles (3 km) from the old Castle of Giffen.[7][15]\nGiffen Castle and Stables was designed in 1869 by John Murray Robertson working in the Dundee office of Andrew and Thomas Arthur Heiton.[16] The building was classified under the category of \"Castle\" and is a Historic Scotland 'B Listed' building.[17]\nGiffen House had been completed for about 50 years when the owner, Mr. Patrick, died in August 1922, leaving the Estate to a nephew in Edinburgh. The nephew sold the estate, which extended to about 8851⁄2 acres, chiefly arable and enclosed land, but it included about 541⁄2 acres of woodland and wooded policies (grounds). It contained 4 public rooms, 6 family bedrooms, 3 dressing rooms, day and night nurseries, bathroom, 6 servants' bedrooms, and ample kitchen and domestic accommodation, making 35 rooms in all. The offices included excellent stabling, garage, lodge, and coachman's house.\nThe Castletoun of Giffen\nGeneral Roy's survey of 1747-55 spells the name as 'Giffin' and indicates a cluster of buildings, a hamlet, on the southern side of the castle.\nThe Chapels and the Chapel Well\nThe chapel and well lay near to Giffen Castle according to John Smith,[18] however another chapel and well dedicated to St. Bridget existed at Trearne on a low hill, with an associated burial ground and a nook in which was set a carving of two figures, possibly a cat and a rabbit, measuring 25 inches (640 mm) by 15 inches (380 mm).[19] The chapel ruins at Trearne were destroyed by quarrying in comparatively recent times. The quarry workers started coming across graves as they worked closer to the chapel and oddly the bodies were found buried face down.[20]\nIn the 12th century the Laird, William de Nenham, had granted land to the monastery of Dryburgh and a chapel was built to the south-east of the castle, possibly next to the well which is still marked on the 2001 OS map, known locally as the Chapel Well.[21] William's son Richard granted more land at this site, however his brother Alexander inherited and wished for his chapel to be held by the monastery of Kilwinning and not Dryburgh. To achieve this end he gave land for a site at Trearne, next to St. Bridget's chapel which had previously been granted to the Monks of Dryburgh.\nThe Barony chapel at Trearne was for the souls of Richard de Morville, William de Morville, Roland of Galloway, Elen de Morville and of their heirs, as well as that of Walter de Mulcaster, his ancestors and his successors.[21] The chapel at Giffen was likely to have been for the same overlords or superiors, but also for Alexander de Nenham, his ancestors and his successors.\nThis situation of excambied[14] or exchanged lands has led to some confusion in that three chapels appear to have existed at one time within the Lordship of Giffen, not two as is usually stated.[22] The other chapel was in Beith.\nGiffen Castle and mill - 2007 The Giffen mill complex and Giffen brae; the road to Mains of Giffen and Burnhouse The woodland denotes the site of old Giffen castle. See the 1860s print above as a comparison. Mains of Giffen, partly built with stones from Giffen castle Mains of Giffen with the site of the old 'castletoun' to the left, and the road to Barrmill from Burnhouse\nThe Lairds of Giffen\nThe Seal of Richard De Morville, Lord of Cunninghame and his Lady Avicia\nIn the 13th century Walter de Mulcaster obtained the lands of 'Giffeyn' as a vassal of the De Morvilles in the reign of William the Lion; and in turn gave them to his sub-vassal, Alexander de Nenham. Alexander gave to the monastery of Dryburgh 50 acres (200,000 m2) which had a chapel and a well to St. Bridget, previously founded by the monastery of Kilwinning, the ruins of which were still to be seen, together with a burial ground. Note that Paterson's version (1866)[12] is at odds with Dobie's (1876) account.[21] The De Morvilles were supporters of John Baliol and upon the succession of Robert the Bruce to the Crown of Scotland they were dispossessed and Giffen reverted to the crown. Sir Hugh de Eglinton married Egidia, sister of Robert II and was given the Lordship in 1370.[23] Giffen then remained in the Montgomerie family for several centuries. The barony seems to have been more or less consistently passed to the Master or heir of Eglinton for many years, however in 1505 the first Earl took the barony into his personal care. After this time the barony passed back and forth amongst the family when cadet lines failed to produce issue.\nThe 1764 coat of arms of the Montgomeries, Earls of Eglinton\nSir Robert Montgomerie, son of Sir John de Montgomerie of Ardrossan, Baron of Parliament, had been the first Montgomerie of Giffen in around 1400. By charter, dated 9 March 1413, the Regent Albany confirmed the grants made by Sir John of Montgomerie of Ardrossan, Knight, to Robert, his son, of the lordship of Giffen in Kyle Stewart.[24] Various sons inherited and in 1560 Patrick Montgomerie was a member of the Great Parliament which established the Protestant faith in Scotland. He was later banished for a time because of his reformation principles and was succeeded by a daughter who married John Montgomerie of Scotstoun and inherited part of the Giffen lands. Being without further issue the Eglinton Montgomeries, in the person of the Hon. Robert, brother to Hugh, the murdered 4th Earl, inherited the barony, producing an heiress, Margaret. He is said incidentally to have \"honourably revenged\" his brother's death, killing John Cunninghame of Clonbeith at Hamilton Palace.[25]\nMargaret married twice, but had no issue and the barony again reverted to the Eglinton branch. Graysteel was the appellation given to Sir Henry Montgomerie of Giffen (due to his dexterity with the sword) who inherited, however he had no issue and once again the barony reverted, as his wife sold the barony of Giffen to her father-in-law for an annuity of 2,500 merks.[26] Henry had been born in 1614 and Anne of Denmark, James VI's Queen, stood as his godmother. The direct Montgomerie line ended with the 5th. Earl who had married his cousin-German,[14] Margaret, eldest daughter and heiress of Robert Montgomerie of Giffen and Master of Eglinton. Their marriage was so unsuccessful that the Earl took the drastic step of revoking her heritable rights as gained through their marriage.[27] and Alexander Seton of Foulstruther, also called 'Grey steel,' took the Montgomerie name upon becoming the 6th Earl of Eglintoun in 1612.[28]\nThe seventh Earl's second son, The Right Hon. Francis inherited and lived an eventful life. He was one of the Lords of the Privy Council, and a Commissioner of the Treasury, in the reign of William III and Queen Anne. He was appointed in 1706 as one of the Commissioners for Scotland for the Treaty of Union. Francis acquired the estate of Hessilhead and built an addition to the old tower as well as slating the roof, making it one of the finest properties in the district on behalf of his eldest son, Lieut.-Colonel John Montgomerie of Giffen, whilst continuing to live at Giffen for the remainder of his life.\nBeith Auld kirk\nHenry married a granddaughter of Alexander Leslie, Earl of Leven the favourite General of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden. She died in her prime and a certain highly valuable jewel, given to her grandfather by the Swedish king and which was to be passed only through her family came into the possession of Henry. The 6th Earl of Leven instigated legal proceedings which eventually saw the jewel returned to the Leslie family.[29] In 1697 Francis was made one of the commissioners looking into witchcraft following the Christian Shaw case. Five out of 24 accused persons were burned at the stake. The Act of Union was very unpopular in some quarters.\nA song of 1706 on the Union reads:-\n\"There's Roseberry, Glasgow, and Dupplin,\nAnd Lord Archibald Campbell and Ross,\nThe President, Francis Montgomery,\nWha ambles liked any paced horse.\"\nIn another, called \"Lines upon the Rogues in Parliament\", is the following stanza:-\n\"Thou Francis of Giffen thou's bigot as hell,\nAnd Brodie in nonsense in this doth excell,\nFor rebellion engrained you may each bear the bell,\nWherefore sin on and be damned.\" The old Giffen aisle at Beith Auld Kirk The blocked up Giffen Aisle doorway The old church end of the aisle\nUpon the death in October 1709 of George Allardyce, Master of the Scottish Mint, John was appointed to the post. He went on to become the MP for Ayr at the 1710 General election, and became one of the Gentleman of the bedchamber to George II, when Prince of Wales. John Montgomerie seems to have been totally uninterested in the affairs of the mint and his personal finances were in some disarray. He at one point proposed an exchange of his post at the mint for a commission in the Foot Guards and ended up with both. He fought in the war against France and was at the disastrous battle of Almanza in Spain. In June 1717 he assigned his salary to a third party, having withdrawn from any active involvement. In 1727 he was appointed as Governor of New York, where he remained until his death on 1 July 1731.[30] He had a daughter Elizabeth, and upon his death the line of the Montgomerie of Giffen became extinct. He had been forced to sell his estates and it was Sir John Anstruther of the Balcaskie family, who purchased Giffen in 1722, under the burden of liferent as Francis was still living.[7] As Fullarton puts it the large and valuable estate of Giffen, is now broken down into a multitude of inglorious fragments, with scarcely a possibility of its ever again being restored and cemented into its original dignity and beneficial condition.[31]\nThe Montgomerie of Giffen coat of arms was quarterly, first and fourth Montgomery, second and third Eglinton; over all, dividing the quarters, a cross waved or, and in chief a label of three points of the last.\nLoch Brand near Gateside was once the property of the monks of Kilwinning Abbey and it is recorded that in 1482 the monks took legal action against the Montgomeries of Giffin Castle and James Ker who were accused of dangerous destruction and down-casting of the fosses and dikes of the loch called Loch Brand.[32]\nThe Giffen Baron-court\nRobert Montgomerie of Giffen was Chamberlain and then Baron-Baillie of the Giffen Baron-court from 1677 to 1681. Another Robert was the Procurator-Fiscal of the same court.[33] Robert Montgomerie of Bogston was a factor and Baron-Bailie of the Giffen Barony-court in the late 17th century.[34]\nThe armorial bearings of the Barony of Giffen\nDetail of the Coat of arms of the Barony of Giffen from the Auld Kirk, now in the Beith Kirk built in 1807\nThe Barony of Giffen coat of arms\nThis coat of arms used to be in the Auld Beith Kirk, in the Giffen loft. The Giffen aisle at the Auld Kirk still stands. The coat of armorial bearings were moved to the new Beith Kirk in 1807. RC is Robert Montgomerie, brother to the murdered Hugh, 4th Earl of Eglinton. JC is for Jean Campbell, his wife, daughter of Sir Matthew Campbell of London. The conjoined MEs either side of the date are for 'Master of Eglintoun', the title which he bore as second son of Hugh, the 3rd Earl, and heir presumptive to his nephew Hugh, the fifth earl; the date is that of his death.[35]\nThe Darien Affair\nThe Darien Scheme was an attempt by the Scots, led by William Paterson (the founder of the Bank of England), in the 1690s to set up a trading colony in Central America in the late 1690s, however the opposition from England and elsewhere was so great that the attempt failed with huge losses and great financial implications for the country and for individuals. Half of the whole circulating capital of Scotland was subscribed and mostly lost, although the Act of Union in 1707 made provision for a degree of compensation to be paid to the Darien subscribers. In Cunninghame some examples of losses are Frances Montgomerie of Giffin (£1000), Major James Cunninghame of Aiket (£200), Sir William Cunninghame of Cunninghamhead (£1000), and James Thomson of Hill in Kilmaurs (£100). In modern terms a thousand pounds loss in the 17th century must have been a devastating blow to the family finances.[29]\nGiffen Mill\nWilliam Aiton's 1811 map showing Giffin\nGiffen Castleclass=notpageimage| The Location of Giffen Castle\nThe old feudal or barony mill, also known as Barmill, Barrmill or Baroil is at Map reference: NS 3699 5133. The remains visible today are early 19th-century, probably rebuilt on an old site, when grain prices were driven up by the Napoleonic Wars. The external stair led to the kiln for drying the corn before it was ground.[36] It was a three-storey, four-bay rubble building on a rectangular plan, now gutted and the upper part used as a store until recently. A small dovecot was in the upper angle of the gable end above the miller's house yard. The mid-18th century substantial miller's house is still occupied and is in good condition. On General Roy's survey of 1747 - 55 Giffin Mill is present with a cluster of buildings nearby. The mill pond and lade are clearly marked on the 1858 OS map and a sand pit is marked nearby. The 1923 - 4 the OS map no longer marks the mill or its lade and mill pond. The machinery was adapted to drive a saw mill before final closure.\nGiffen would have been the thirled[14] mill of the barony, thirlage being the feudal law by which the laird (lord) of Giffen could force all those vassals or suckeners[14] living on his lands to bring their grain to his mill to be ground. Additionally the suckeners had to carry out repairs on the mill, maintain the lade and weir as well as conveying new millstones to the site.[37][38]\nUnder thirlage the suckeners had to convey new millstones to their thirled mill, sometimes over significant distances, in this case they probably came from West Kilbride. The width of some of the first roads was determined by the requirement to have at least two people on either side of a new grindstone being transported, with a wooden axle called a 'mill-wand' passed through the hole in the centre.\nAs has already been mentioned, the miller's house had two carved stones from Giffen Castle built into its walls and a further one built into the gable end wall of the mill itself. In 2006/2007 the miller's house was renovated, however the other carved stones were not found during the re-roughcasting; they had been on the front.[39] The grandfather of the present owner had the stones chipped off; they were located either side of the main entrance door. The 'Eagle' on the mill gable end is still in situ (see photograph).\nDetails of Giffen Mill - 2007 The remains of the waterwheel inside the mill extension Inside the mill looking towards Greenhill The main mill machinery The adaptations to drive the saw mill.

The school opened in the 1890s at the time that Hessilhead school closed. Greenhills closed circa 1958 and was demolished in the mid-1980s; having been used for some years as a glue factory by Strathbond Ltd who still trade from the Willowyard Estate, Beith. Mr McGregor was the last headteacher and the sports field had been the field lying across the Barrmill to Burnhouse Road.[40] A smithy stood at the crossroads on the Borestone farm side of the hamlet. This hamlet is named after the artificial mound, a Moot, Law or Justice hill that once stood here.\nThe Moot or Justice hill\nThis artificial mound or moot hill was the site where proclamations of the Giffen Castle Baronial Court's judgements were made. For serious crimes the men were hung here and women were drowned a pit which would have been nearby. This situation, known as the feudal Barony right of 'pit and gallows'[14] existed at many other sites, such as at Beith, Kilmarnock, Aiket, Ardrossan, and Dalry. Often the mounds were wooded and a Dule Tree may have been used as the gallows. Brehons or Judges administered justice from 'Court Hills', especially in the highlands. Auchenmade had a Law hill mound nearby, possibly destroyed by the railway. The 'Green hill' stood near to Greenhill farm.[41] No sign of the moot hill seems to survive, however a bridge near to Greenhill is marked as 'Tappethillock', meaning a flat-topped hillock, which may refer to it.\nBorestone farm and the Bore stane\nBorestone Farm from Greenhills lane\nIn 1876 Dobie recorded that the Bore Stone or Stane was a large sandstone about 111⁄2 inches in diameter, situated on the farm of Borestone to which it gave name (Name Book 1856). It had a circular opening in which it is said the flagstaff of the lordship or barony used to be erected when vassals from the neighbourhood were summoned to battle; at this position it would have been visible to all parts of the barony and beyond.[13][41] but it is more likely to be a natural cavity caused by weathering. The farmer, Mr Craig, was not sure in 1895 if the stone was genuine, we will never know as the Bore Stone was broken up in about 1950 according to Mrs Raeside of Borestone Farm. It was at map reference: NS 3742 5054.[42] During World War II the borestone was used by troops who were training in the area.[43]\nThirdpart and the Hessilhead feud\nThirdpart was an 8s. land, part of the Giffen Barony and in 1663 feued to John Wilson by the Earl of Eglinton. It remained in that family until at least 1876. James Wilson of Thirdpart was a notable local eccentric who wrote and published poems on such topics as the 'Trearne Cattle Shows', the 'Fall of Giffin Castle' and the 'Misfortunes of a clocking-hen'. James died in 1838.[44] William Wilson who lived here in 1837 was a brick and tile maker. A small mansion had been present here, occupied in the 1570s by John Montgomerie of Scotstoun, a near relative of the Laird of Hessilhead.[45]\nThirdpart Farm from Bank of Giffen\nHessilhead (Hasil head) castle in 1876\nA dreadful series of incidents occurred in the locality, starting on 19 July 1576 when the Lady of Hessilhead slapped one Robert Kent, servant to Gabriel, brother of John Montgomerie, for some grave offence given. The servant complained to his master and Gabriel went to his brother at the old Thirdpart mansion for advice. John advised him to seek revenge and therefore the next morning Gabriel and Robert gained entry into Hessilhead castle where they found the lady alone, upon which they grabbed her by the hair, pulled her onto the floor, kicked her in the bowels, and bruised her shamefully. Gabriel intended to shoot the Laird, however the whole household was now awake and the two only just managed to escape by stealing a horse and locking the castle gate from the outside. The Laird,[14] Hew Montgomerie, hastened to Thirdpart where John and Gabriel came out with pistols and drawn swords and attacked Hew Montgomerie, injuring him on various parts of his body and leaving him for dead. He was rescued by some neighbours who took him to Hessilhead castle where he recovered from his wounds. Soon afterwards Hessilhead men, including one named Giffen, killed Gabriel after setting up an ambush for him. On 26 August John, Kent and another brother, Walter, went to try to kill the Laird, but could not find him. Amazingly the results of the various court cases was that no one was found guilty of any of the offences, most likely because honour had been satisfied on both sides.[46][47]\nHessilhead was the home of Alexander Montgomerie (1545–1611), master poet and songster in the court of King James VI. He is best remembered for his poem, The Cherrie and the slae.[48]\nBank of Giffen\nGreenhills from Bank of Giffen\nBank of Giffen Farm ruins\nIn 1858 a farm known as 'Bank of Giffen' stood below the whinstone ridge which is close to what is now the old railway line across the road from Thirdpart farm; it is shown as abandoned in 1911. General Roy's map of 1747 - 55 marks its as 'Bank' only. Some ruins of the farm are still visible today (2007). A Ley tunnel is said to run from Bank of Giffen to Giffen Castle; some years back a couple of children are said to have found he tunnel and safely made their way through.\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Barony and Castle of Giffen.\nNettlehirst House and estate\nMain article: Nettlehirst\nNettlehirst was a fine mansion, also known as 'Nettlehurst', a castle-like structure overlooking the old Giffen Station and Dusk Water on the high ground above the limekilns. The Burns family built Nettlehirst House in 1844. William Burns became a toy-maker.[49] In July 1932 the house burned down, possibly due to an electrical fire. The dramatic fire coincided with the return from South Beach by a special train of Barrmill Sunday School trip on the line from Ardrossan to Giffen Station. The fierce fire was clearly visible from the train and it was a talking point in the village for months.\nThe mansion house was never restored and shortly afterwards the dangerous ruin was demolished. The unusual entrance gatepiers, apple and pear orchard, boundary walls, mausoleum, farm and the stables, with its crow stepped gable ends and an 1811 marriage stone remain. The platform of the old tennis court is still apparent.[50]\nThe OS Map shows a family burial ground located near woodland to the south of the old house site. The fine red sandstone structure still survives (2010) although the crypt has been broken into and the frontage stones are much disturbed. No inscriptions are apparent on the structure. Nettlehirst's old groom's cottage and stables. Nettlehirst old estate wall and trees. A ruin within the Nettlehirst grounds bearing an 1811 marriage stone. A side entrance The back of the mausoleum The frontage\nA confusing number of properties in the area are known as Nettlehirst, some distinctions being made by adding 'cottage' or the owners name, such as Reid Nettlehirst. The origin of the placename itself is unknown, however the 'Nettle' may refer to the plant and 'Hurst' may refer to harvest; meaning an area where nettles predominate. The term 'hairst' might refer to a barren hillock, knoll, or ridge. A fitting description of the site today.\nBarrmill\nMain article: Barrmill, North Ayrshire\nDrumbuie House, a property in the Barony of Giffen\nNettlehirst Farm in 2009\nGeneral Roy's survey of 1747 - 55 shows only the farm of High Barr. A village grew up here due to the employment provided by the several limestone quarries that were present at one time, the Dockra Ironstone pit that was located near the railway line down from Dockra quarry in 1912, and other local industries.\nThe village (co-ordinates 55 43' 45.2'' N | 04 36' 3.8'' W) that developed had a population of 300 in 1876 and 600 in 1951, when the threadmaking industry had just ceased, although the workers still lived in company houses and were transported daily to the threadmaking factory at Kilbirnie. The limestone works was still active, but it too closed in 1972. The whinstone quarries of Messrs. King & Co. employed a considerable number of men in 1951, but even then the quarries were almost worked out.[51] Giffen coal pit (No 1) lay close to Bankhead Moss as shown on the 1897 OS map, closing not long afterwards as the following OS maps cease showing it. The 1912 OS map marks the quoiting ground which was in what is now the park, close to the old railway embankment; a mission hall is also shown, located just the other side of the railway bridge over the Beith branchline. In 2006 a new housing estate was created on the site of the old Barrmill railway station and goods yard.\nThe local railways\nThe Gree Viaduct in 2007, now demolished, on the former line between Lugton and Giffen\nAt NS 356 5111 was Giffenmill Viaduct, opened 1903 by the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway. A 7-span viaduct, with semi-circular concrete arches, it became disused in 1950 and was demolished in 2006. It was also known as the Barr Mill or Dusk Water viaduct. The nearby Gree Viaduct stood until its demolition in early 2008. The local station opened on 3 September 1888 and was known as Kilbirnie Junction, however it was renamed Giffen on 1 October 1889.[52] Giffen closed in 1932, but it had three platforms, a small station building, and at one point at least seven members of staff. The platforms still survive (2007), but the line running through the station serving DMC Beith is no longer in use (2007).\nBarrmill railway station served the village of Barrmill and was originally part of the Glasgow, Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway branch from Lugton to Beith. It was the only intermediate station on the route, opening on 26 June 1873, and closing permanently to passengers on 5 November 1962. It was a single platformed station. Freight services continued on the line until 1964. On the 1897 OS map a tramway is shown running down to Barrmill station from quarries at Dockra.\nViews of Giffen station (2008) Looking towards Barrmill from the Giffen overbridge Giffen railway station from the overbridge Giffen station looking towards Barrmill The Old Kilbirnie Junction station, later Giffen station in 2006 Pointwork and an old security gate An old blast wall next to the station Workmen's hut near the blast wall Old sign for munitions traffic operations\nGiffen, Beith, or Nettlehirst limeworks\nGiffen Limeworks dated from the mid- to late 19th century and later. They were probably the last traditional limeworks to work in Scotland, closing in 1972. A substantial amount remained, the kilns being essentially intact in 2009, with a bank of two single-draw rubble kilns, reinforced with buttresses and with old rails, and heightened in brick. Progressive demolition has been taking place since 2009. Covered conveyors linked the segmental-arched draw holes with a wood-framed, corrugated-iron crushing and bagging mill. The works were at map reference: NS 3645 5073.\nLimekilns\nThe remains of the old limekiln near Nettlehirst farm\nDetail of the old Nettlehirst lime kiln\nLimekilns are a common feature of farms in the area, such as Thirdpart, Foreside, Nettlehirst and the Greenhills hamlet; the necessary limestone was quarried extensively in the neighbourhood. Limekilns came into regular use about the 18th century. Large limestone blocks were used for building but the smaller pieces were burnt, using coal dug in the parish[53] to produce lime which was a useful commodity in various ways: it could be spread on the fields to reduce acidity, for lime-mortar in buildings or for lime-washing on farm buildings and was even regarded as cleansing agent.\nViews of Giffen, Greenhills, and Barrmill (2007) The old school site at Greenhills The line and old signal running towards Giffen station The old railway line running towards Lugton at Barmill old line near Tandlehill Farm The course of the old 'Hillhead Railway' from Barkip Junction to Broadstone limestone quarry The Giffin House main entrance, near Auchenmade The Old Station Inn in Barrmill Barrmill crossroads, with hotel and shop Barrmill's Community Hall Barrmill's millennium garden Barrmill's mainstreet with the railway bridge, looking towards Greenhills Barrmill's park\nBurnhouse (The Trap)\nMain article: Burnhouse\nThis village or hamlet in North Ayrshire, known locally as the 'Trap',[54] short for 'Man Trap' as the village lies on the old turnpike road from Beith to Kilmarnock, and the more recent and busy Lochlibo Road from Irvine to Glasgow via Lugton where travellers on their return from markets in the old days were encouraged to stop and spend their money at the inn; it was so named by the farmers wives and eventually it was shorted to 'The Trap'.[55] A Crossroads Inn is marked on John Thomson's map of 1828 and in 1858 it had two inns at the crossroads, the Burnhouse Inn and the Waggoners Inn, no longer shown on the 1911 OS.\nWhat is now Burnhouse Manor hotel was present as a private house on the 1858 OS map and as the 'Manor House' in 1911. In the 1870s, whilst nearby Trearne House was being built, Mr and Mrs Ralston-Patrick lived for some time in Burnhouse Manor until the new house was ready for them. A toll house was located on the Dunlop side of the crossroads on the Lochlibo Road, on the Laigh Gree Farm side; it has been demolished.\nBurnhouse Manor and 'The Trap' village (2008) The Burnhouse Manor Hotel Burnhouse village looking towards Lugton Another view looking towards Lugton\nAdditional evidence from maps\nThe 1858 OS map shows the spelling as 'Giffen' and indicates the presence of a small whinstone quarry at the bottom of the brae that runs towards Burnhouse. This quarry expanded over the years and eventually destroyed the site of the castle on the Giffen craigs. The castle ruins are clearly marked in 1858, but not afterwards.\nDrumbuie\nDrumbuie House, built in 1702, is one of the oldest inhabited houses in the Beith area and has been the home of the Boyd family for at least three generations.[56] Drumbuie was part of the Barony of Giffen and was feud out to various local millers and farmers in the 17th century.[57] Close records that Drumbuie Farm incorporates an early 18th-century two-storey house, originally thatched, which was built around 1736 for Hugh Patrick, this being stated on a plaque on the 1815 addition.[58] A James Nevin of Drumbuie was a witness to the will of Hugh Nevin of Kirkwood in 1677.[59] Drumbuie mill was located nearby on the Dusk Water, however no obvious physical remains are extant.\nMossend Farm\nRuins of Mossend Farm\nThe copse at Mossend Farm\nThis may have been the site of a minor mansion house at one time, however by the 1920s only a ruin remained. A whinstone quarry was located to the east of the dwelling. The last occupants of Mossend were George and Ellen Black who used to ride into Beith on a small buggy behind a piebald pony. George was a manufacturer of curling stones, possibly using the whinstone from the Mossend quarry.[60]\nLocal history and traditions\nA mound near Greenhill farm\nDockra and South Border Farms\nThe Ayrshire Directory 1837 by Pigot & Co comments, a year before Giffen Castle collapsed, on ...the stately ruined castle of the Montgomeries. The same publication also lists a Land Surveyor named John Giffin and a John Giffen who was associated with the schools.\nA small hoard of 16th-century coins was found on 7 March 1958 by A Wilson and A M Raeside when ploughing 250 yards (230 m) southwest of Mains of Giffen. The coins had been placed in the bronze container of a small nest of weights, 11⁄2 inches in diameter. This box, and 12 of the 19 coins were retained by the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland (NMAS). All Scottish, they dated between 1558 (a billon \"nonsunt\" of Mary) and 1574 (a half-merk[14] of James VI). The coins are mostly half and quarter-merks of James VI; they were probably hidden in the later 1570s.[61]\nRoughwood Farm was once the caput of a barony within the Lordship of Giffen.\nRecords show that a William Giffen was appointed councillor in 1710 at Corsehill. Trearne house was used by a small boarding school called Gresham House until it was demolished in 1954.\nThe Lugton Ridges were part of the Barony of Giffen and one was also known as Deepstone.[62]\nThe Dusk Water which powered Giffen Mill joins the River Garnock at Dalgarven and one of Ayrshire's most interesting natural curiosities, Cleeves Cove cave system is in the Dusk Glen, downstream of Giffen, near Cleeves farm.\nThe herb 'Dusky Cranesbill' is a rare garden escape.

    "text": "Historic site in Fairlie, North Ayrshire\nKelburn Castle is a large house near Fairlie, North Ayrshire, Scotland. It is the seat of the Earl of Glasgow. Originally built in the thirteenth century (the original keep forms the core of the house) it was remodelled in the sixteenth century. In 1700, the first Earl made further extensions to the house in a manner, not unlike a French château which is virtually how it appears today. In 1977 the house and grounds opened to the public as a country park. It is one of the oldest castles in Scotland and has been continuously inhabited by the same family for longer than any other. The castle is protected as a category A listed building,[1] while the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.[2]\nWhen it was found in 2007 that the castle's concrete facing would soon need replacing, Lord Glasgow invited four Brazilian graffiti artists to decorate the walls. This was still in place in 2011, when the Earl sought permission from Historic Scotland to keep the graffiti permanently.\nHistory\nKelburn Castle in 1994\nKelburn Castle in Spring\nThe Boyle family have been in possession of the lands of Kelburn since the 12th century.[1]\nThe castle is thought to have been built in the 13th century and, although no one knows the exact date of the first stone laid, the castle was there during the Battle of Largs, which was fought between the Scots and the Norwegians in 1263.[3]\nThe first structure was a wood tower. This wooden tower was replaced in the 1200s with a stone Norman Keep, sections of which are still in use today.[4]\nIn the late 16th century a tower house was built. This replaced an earlier structure, and may incorporate parts of the earlier masonry its eastern part.[1] In the 17th century, orchards and gardens are recorded at Kelburn.[2] David Boyle (1666–1733), a member of the Parliament of Scotland, was created Earl of Glasgow in 1703. He began the new north-west wing of the house, which was completed circa 1722. The 1st Earl doubled the size of the building by adding a William-and-Mary style mansion house onto the Castle at a slight angle, built to the Earl’s instructions by the well-known mason, Thomson Caldwell.[4]\nGeorge Boyle, 6th Earl of Glasgow (1825–1890), added the north-east wing in 1880.\nThe 7th Earl of Glasgow, who was made Governor of New Zealand in 1892, provides the links between the Kelburn Estate and Kelburn in New Zealand. Many of his souvenirs still reside at the castle, and in the Estate’s Museum.[3]\nFollowing the opening of the grounds to the public, the estate buildings and stables were converted in 1980, to provide a tea room, shop and visitor information.[2]\nGraffiti project\nIn 2007 experts told the owners of Kelburn Castle that its concrete facing would eventually need to be replaced to avoid further damage to the stonework. At the suggestion of his children, Lord Glasgow invited four Brazilian graffiti artists (Nunca, Nina and Os Gêmeos twins) to paint the walls.[5] Historic Scotland agreed to the project, on the basis that the graffiti would be removed when the castle was re-harled. The project was featured on the BBC television programme The Culture Show. Also in 2007, Kelburn featured in another BBC programme, Crisis at the Castle which documented the financial problems of running the castle.[6]\nIn September 2010 it was reported that Historic Scotland were putting pressure on Lord Glasgow to remove the graffiti,[7] although this was later denied by both parties.[8] In August 2011 it was reported that the Earl had formally written to Historic Scotland asking permission to keep the graffiti as a permanent feature.[9]\nFire damage\nThe castle suffered minor fire damage on 16 February 2009, as a result of an electrical fault. The fire service was called to a blaze at around 1:45 am where flames had engulfed a top-floor room and spread to the roof. Around 25 firefighters battled the blaze for more than five hours before it was extinguished at around 7:20 am.[10]\nKelburn Country Centre\nThe 10th Earl of Glasgow, Patrick Boyle, and his family still reside at the castle. It was his decision to open the estate to the public in 1977, transforming the grounds and outhouses into play areas, a café, gift shop, etc, and also allowing access to the castle for tours.\nThe grounds are open daily 10am - 6pm from Easter to October, with shorter hours through the winter.\nThere are three outdoor play areas including the Secret Forest, which is a fairy tale trail through the woodland. There's also the Wild Wild West Saloon and the Adventure Course.\nEvents\nKelburn is popular for its imaginative events calendar. Numerous family friendly events run throughout the year, offering outdoor, interactive, and creative fun. The team also host a scarily fun Halloween event, recommended for over 16s.[11]\nThe Estate becomes home to the 6000 capacity music festival, The Kelburn Garden Party each year in July.[12] \"The Kelburn Garden Party is a music and arts festival that explodes across numerous stages, nooks and spaces throughout the magical glen and stunning gardens that surround Kelburn Castle on Scotland's West Coast. We pack as much music, performance, art and entertainment as we can into this unique environment, with surreal and magical results. It's a cultural safari for the mind, body and soul.\"[12]\nThe estate is available for weddings, with 5 licensed spots for exchanging vows plus 2 reception venues.[13] The Functions Team also organise corporate events and parties.\nGlamping and Camping\nThere are 8 yurts available for hire at Kelburn.[14] Sat on the hillside campsite, the accommodation offers views over the Firth of the Clyde and its islands. A glass fronted facilities block offers toilet, shower and kitchen facilities, plus seating.\nThere are also bell tents available, and the ability to bring your own tent or camper van.[15]\nThe Kel Burn\nThe Kel burn has helped form the glen over thousands of years. In the space of just over half a mile, it rises on the moors over 800 feet above the castle and drops dramatically, by way of many waterfalls and gorges, to the sea. The glen is a wealth of wild flowers and ferns, shrubs and trees. Walks up the glen reveal views across Largs, the Firth of Clyde and over to Arran.\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Kelburn Castle.\nOfficial site\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Ruin castle in Scotland\nKerelaw Castle is a castle ruin. It is situated on the coast of North Ayrshire, Scotland in the town of Stevenston.\nHistory\nThis castle, variously named Kerelaw, Kerila or even Turnlaw,[1][2]: p. 17 is said by Timothy Pont to have been held by the Lockharts from Richard de Morville, Constable of Scotland, as far back as 1191,[3] after Stephen Lockhart or Loccard[4] obtained a grant of land in Ayrshire. This land would be named Stevenstoune (later Stevenston) after himself, and their manor-place of the barony of Stevenston, named Kerelaw.[5] The castle and barony were eventually passed on to the Campbells of Loudoun and later to the Cunninghames (or Cunninghams/Cuninghames) of Kilmaurs. It was in the Cunninghame's possession in 1488 that the castle was sacked and burned by the 2nd Lord Montgomerie, during the well documented and long-term feud between these two prominent Ayrshire families.[6]: p. 15–16 The Cunninghames, led by the Earl of Glencairn burned Eglinton Castle to the ground in revenge in 1528.[7]\nKerila or Kerelaw Castle in the 1860s[8]\nKerelaw was rebuilt sometime after 1488 and is reported to have contained a number of carved coats of arms of the Scottish nobility, taken from Kilwinning Abbey,[9] Nine fishermen from Saltcoats were granted leases in 1545 in return for carrying the Earl's furniture to Finlayston on the Clyde every spring from the Creek of Saltcoats and bringing it back again in the autumn when the family returned to Kerelaw for the winter months. A half barrel of herrings was also to be furnished yearly to the Earl.[10]\nAbode of the Abbots\nLocal tradition is that the castle had been the residence of the Abbot of Kilwinning, which may have arisen from the fact that the third son of Alexander Cunningham, 1st Earl of Glencairn, became the Commendator of the abbey after the reformation and may have lived at Kerelaw.\nThe southern castle wall in 2006\nLater history\nCoat of Arms of the Hamiltons of Grange[6]: Plate 6 In 1609 it was bought by Sir Thomas Boyd and soon after sold again to Sir William Cunninghame of Cunninghamhead. Thirty years later the castle and the nearby lands were bought by Sir Robert Cunninghame of Auchenharvie. In 1655 Kerelaw Castle was purchased by Alexander Hamilton (the grandfather of Alexander Hamilton, a founding father of the United States of America), formerly of Cambuskeith (now known as 'The Mount'), and afterwards of Grange, who changed the name of the castle and its grounds to Grange, after the family home in Kilmarnock. Clements, Graham and McLatchie give the date of 1685 for the sale of Kerila (Kerelaw) to John Hamilton by Robert Reid Cunninghame of Seabank House (Auchenharvie) whose mining activities were causing him financial difficulties.[2]: p. 13 [11][12] The castle became the residence of the Hamilton family until 1787 when another Alexander Hamilton (second cousin of the American politician), built Kerelaw (or Grange) House nearby, with the castle quickly becoming disused.[13]\nThe foundation stone of the new Eglinton Castle in Kilwinning was laid in 1797 by Alexander Hamilton of Grange on behalf of the 12th Earl of Eglinton.[14]\nAn OS map of the Kerelaw Estate from 1910\nAncillary buildings\nKerelaw castle ruins in 1890 with the Laburnum tree reputed to have been sent by David Livingstone from Africa[2]\nA dovecote or doocot dated 1775 existed here[15] (see illustration) until the 1960s when it was demolished together with other outbuildings. Cottages for the workpeople had been built in the court of the castle, and their high corbie-stepped gable-ends added to the picturesque effect of the castle ruins.[16] The gothic windows may be one of the 19th century additions to the buildings.[17] A limekiln was also situated nearby at NS 2706 4309. Dudups (Diddup) nearby was part of the Kerelaw/Grange Estate.[18]\nRoy's Survey map of 1747 records the name as Kerry-law,[19] and Smith refers to it as Kerila Castle;[20] as does Paterson.[8] Kyryaw castle, mains and mill are marked on Ponts map of 1604–1608. A lodge house, situated to the east of the castle is marked on the older OS maps and is still in existence today (2008) as a private home.\nLater history\nThe house, the castle and the grounds were all sold in 1838 to Gavin Fullerton after Alexander's death. Fullerton soon restored the original name of Kerelaw.\nThe castle today\nOrnate carved keystone quatrefoil from above the bridge's arch.\nThe old Kerelaw doocot of which nothing now remains[15]\nKerelaw Castle is now a ruin, with three walls surviving in various states of decay. Gothic windows still adorn the southern wall, believed to have been inspired by those at Kilwinning Abbey (and are proof that much of the castle was built at various points in history).\nIn 1852 Paterson noted arrow-slits and cable mouldings of pre-14th century date.[21] An old bridge, now used for pedestrians only, is situated next to the ruin (NS 2688 4288), but the castle itself is fenced off to protect both the public from falling stone and the castle from unwanted attention. The castle and surrounding ground is owned by North Ayrshire Council. In 2014 some repairs were carried out on the building and the immediate surroundings were cleared of excess trees and shrubs that were harming and hiding the structure. A QR Code and heritage trail plaque are attached to the fence and an interpretation board is present.\nThe bridge has a large cavity or 'cave' within it and this once gave access to pedestrians using the path that ran parallel to the Stevenston Burn.[22] The arch of the bridge and the 'cave' show that the bridge was built in two stages and was widened with the upstream side being more recent. A large ornately carved cruciform embellishment has fallen from the bridge arch and lies downstream from the bridge.\nThe castle's former walled garden with its sundials and complex flowerbed layout is now occupied by a housing estate built in the late 1960s, but a single wall of the structure still remains. In the 1850s an orchard is shown on OS maps, located next to the walled garden.\nA cobbled ford once crossed the Stevenston Burn in the Kerelaw Glen beneath the castle and ran up the bank passed the Kerelaw Mains home farm. The later limestone quarry workings destroyed the lane leading up from the ford. Two footbridges crossed the burn, one at the surviving weir and the other beyond the quarry house where mortared ashlar dressed stone walls still survive.[23]\nViews of the castle and surroundings One of the surviving gothic-style windows in 2008 The last remnants of the castle's walled garden in 2008 A bricked up entrance to the former walled garden in 2008 The remains of the eastern castle wall in 2006 Remains of the old ford.

    "text": "Barony and castle west of the town of Kilbirnie in North Ayrshire, Scotland\nThe substantial remains of the old castle and sixteenth century manor house of Kilbirnie lie west of the town of Kilbirnie in North Ayrshire, Scotland, on the lower slopes of the Glengarnock Hills, in the old Barony of Kilbirnie. The building is also variously known as the Place of Kilbirnie, The Place, or Kilbirnie House.\nThe site lies close to a stream and small but deep ravine that once provided a defensive function for the castle site. The castle and manor house themselves are not in the grounds of the Kilbirnie Place Golf Club, which was itself laid out in 1925 on the old landscaped 'pleasure grounds' once attached to the castle site.[1]\nThe OS maps show that a much later estate and house called Place was located nearby, built by the Knox family but now mostly demolished.[2]\nHistory\nOne of three \"Lairds Lofts\" at Kilbirnie parish church\nThe name \"Kilbirnie\" is derived from the Gaelic language, and means \"Church of St Brendan\".[3] The parish was divided into three baronies: Kilbirnie, Ladyland, and Glengarnock. The feudal Barony of Kilbirnie was the largest in the parish at around 5500 acres and had the most fertile quarter with 3000 acres of arable, pasture and woodland.[4]\nKilbirnie Castle is said to be the site where in 1263 the Scots mustered under Alexander III before fighting Norwegian forces in the Battle of Largs.[5]\nThe castle's location is on high ground above the bend of a deep ravine, giving the site some protection along its west and north sides although it is set back from the edge of this ravine. The word place in Scots refers to a landed proprietor's mansion house,[6] and is equivalent in meaning to the English word \"palace\",[7] although the term \"palace\" acquired its present connotations at a much later date.[8] The dwelling is clearly seen as being in two quite distinct parts: one a substantial defensive tower built in about 1470 for Malcolm Crawfurd and his wife, Marjory Barclay, an heiress and the last of her line; the other part is dated to 1627 and is a more comfortable dwelling with no significant defensive features. The entrance to the new 'wing' has a very unusual and prominent projecting porch on the south front.[9]\nGothic script set into the 'Grand Hall' fireplace.\nTimothy Pont's map, c. 1604, as published by Joan Blaeu in Amsterdam (1654), shows Kilbirnan Castle (sic), as this date precedes the building of the mansion house wing.[10] John Adair's map of c. 1685 shows a castellated structure recorded as Kilburny.[11] Roy's map of 1747 shows the castle and the landscaped avenue feature. A Mains Farm is shown located near to Kilbirnie Kirk.[12] The 1832 Thomson map records 'Killbirny House' and shows a lane running directly from the house to the kirk.[13] The 1856 OS map of refers to 'Kilbirnie House'.[14]\nThe Honourable Patrick Lindsay purchased the castle and estate of Glengarnock in 1677 from Richard Cuninghame, the last of the Cuninghames of the Barony of Glengarnock. In 1707 both baronies were united in the Barony of Kilburnie, with the Manor House of Kilbirnie as the principal messuage.[15]\nKeep\nThis very impressive 15th-century structure measures 42 feet by 33 feet, with walls between 7 feet and 8 feet in thickness.[16] A cellar was present and a sleeping loft under a vault. Another vault had a hall, lit by three windows in the south wall and a window high up in the north wall, a private room lay beneath. The tower was four storeys high and in the north-west corner a \"starving pit\" prison was entered by a hatch from a passage from the stair at loft level.[17] Gun ports are not present.[18]\nThe entrance to the 'Starving Pit' in the castle keep.\nIn 1602 the Place of Kilbirnie was broken into whilst the laird \"was furth of this realme\" and his wife Margaret was at Greenock. A John Crawfurd of \"Auchinbothe\" was arrested and tried, however he was found innocent despite having returned some of the stolen items to Lady Kilbirnie. The charter chest was one of the items broken into and items removed from.[19]\nAt the north-eastern side of the keep are ruins that represent the site of an oven and other building remnants that probably represent the site of the kitchens.[20]\nDivine protection\nSet within the main fireplace of the keep are two red sandstone carved pieces with Gothic script. One reads 'Maria' and the other with smaller script has not been deciphered. Sandstone pillars on either side of this fireplace carry carvings of climbing plants that may be ivy. One suggestion regarding the Gothic script carvings in the fireplace is that they could be the names of saints and that this was a religious 'Apotropaic' protective device to prevent the ingress of evil spirits into the house through an otherwise 'unprotected' entry point.\nThe Puritans acted against images of the Virgin Mary however a widespread use of her name or more usually initials continued.[21] The Gothic script and positioning on the stone suggests that a secondary use from a tomb and this would be seen as doubly potent if it was once housed within the nearby Kilwinning Abbey as it would be seen to have been infused with holy energies.\nThe old main entrance to the keep was at the east angle of the north side and later entered into a courtyard. The ground level is now considerably raised up and only the arch of the door can be seen.\nMansion\nThis wing was constructed in 1627 at right angles to the old keep using rubble faced with dressed with sandstone ashlar.[22] A door was broken through from the hall of the old keep to a staircase in the mansion house. The mansion was a fine specimen of 17th-century architecture.[18] It had turrets corbelled out at hall level and these contained closets. The front door was set in an unusual shallow projection and a narrow back door at the north facing aspect led into a courtyard. Two cellars existed with a passage between them that connected with the main staircase.[17] The hall in the old tower may have been used as a dining area and the large room in the mansion house utilised as a drawing-room.[18] The most southerly turret and a large part of mansion house wing fell at some point between 1956 and 1964.[23]\nFire\nLady Jean Lindsay as Countess of Eglinton.\nThe buildings were destroyed by fire early in the morning of 1 May 1757 during construction works, and never rebuilt. A servant who was going to the stables saw that smoke was rising from the roof and gave the alarm.[24] The 21st Earl of Crawfurd, his infant daughter Jean (later a Countess of Eglinton) and domestics had little time to escape the ferocity of the flames.[25] The family moved to the Kilbirnie Barony manse at first and later settled at Bourtreehill House near Irvine.[26] Lady Crawfurd was the eldest daughter and heiress of Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill.[27]\nThe remains of the 'Grand Avenue'.\nRegarding the cause of the fire, the story goes that before going to bed, a lady of the house threw melted grease from the socket of a large candlestick into a fire grate in a lower storey of the house and the ensuing flames set alight the unswept chimney flue, the fire rapidly entering the new mansion wing through windows in the garret that had been left open by workmen. The keys had been taken offsite by carpenters and access to control the fire was impossible. Large numbers of people turned out to help, but their assistance was to no avail. Until the death of the earl in 1781 the cause had been carefully concealed and supernatural forces held to blame.[28]\nSome of the buildings were retained for a time as a hunting lodge.[29]\nPleasure gardens\nThe approach to the building from the south was a long straight avenue twenty yards wide, bordered by high walls and once enclosing large gardens.[16] The section down to Causewayfoot was bordered by walls and the section down to the termination at Fudstone (now demolished) was tree-lined only. The remnants of the 'Grand Avenue' are still discernable.[30] A substantial walled garden in two portions ran down from the castle to the ravine or glen, long abandoned, and shown on the OS maps with a set of steps between the tow portions and a small building attached to the wall on the northern side. Paterson records that the extensive pleasure-grounds were \"torn up by the plough\".[31] The gardens once contained flowers and shrubs, potatoes, turnips, and orchards.[27] As late as 1856 the walled garden is shown as containing what may have been apple trees of which one survives (2015).[14]\nEstate\nRuins of the walled garden.\nThe mains farm is recorded as Place Farm and sometimes, confusingly, as Kilbirnie Place. The old castle site is recorded as Kilbirnie House. A lane ran up to the Largs Road from Causewayfoot, via a dwelling at Parkfoot, now demolished, crossing the Paduff Burn rivulet by a ford.\nBirinie's well was a spring that supplied excellent water. It was about a quarter of a mile north of the Kilbirnie Castle ruins and water was carried to the castle by pipes. The well was named after St Brendan (Sanctus Birinius), a 6th century saint associated with Kilbirnie Church. The well has been 'capped' and its site sits at the end of an old path.[14][32]\nOrdnance Survey (OS) maps show that a sandstone quarry was located at Causewayfoot, overlooked by the old but now demolished dwelling at Selsy, with cottages and the farm of Causewayfoot standing nearby. A small ironstone pit was also present. The OS 6 in. of 1897, 1911, 1938 show a trapezoidal curling pond south-west of Kilbirnie Castle and records show that a match was played between Kilbirnie v. Dalry 3 rinks each, on 20 February 1895.[33] The curling pond built below the Causewayfoot is now drained and overgrown, shown as already abandoned in 1938. A lozenge-shaped curling pond at Fudstone south-west of the dwelling is shown on OS 6 in. 1st ed. ca. 1860, 1897 and 1911.[33] The Nether Mill is recorded as the Barony Mill of Kilbirnie under the name Nethermiln of Kilbirnie.\nAuld Kirk of Kilbirnie\nThe arms of the Barclays, impaled with those of Crawfurd are carved on a panel located on the tower of the kirk.[34] The Crawfurds added the Crawfurd Aisle to the Auld Kirk with its fine Renaissance-style carvings of 1642.[26] A private apartment is located behind with the family burial vaults lying beneath. The numerous heraldic shields were carved for John, first Viscount Garnock, and represent the armorial bearings of his ancestors.[34]\nAssociated families\nBarclays\nThe castle passed from the Barclays to the Crawfurds through the marriage of Marjory, an heiress, to Malcolm Crawfurd.[26] Marjory was the daughter of Sir John Barclay of Kilbirnie and Craufurd-John.[35] These Barclays of Kilbirnie are thought to have been a branch of the ancient family of the Barclays of Ardrossan. Sir Walter Barclay was Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland in 1174 and married Margaret Crawfurd of Craufurd-John. Marjory was descended from this line.[35]\nCrawfurds\nThe main entrance to the 16th-century wing.\nIn 1470 Thomas Crawfurd, sometimes written as Crauford or Crawford, obtained the castle through marriage.[26] He was descended from the Crawfurds of Loudoun Castle.[36] John Crawfurd married Margaret Blair, daughter of John Blair of that Ilk,[19] and their son, John Crawfurd, married Lady Mary Cunningham, the daughter of James, 7th Earl of Glencairn.[37] Their son, Sir John Crawfurd, was knighted by Charles I in 1642 and fought in the Civil Wars, but died without any heirs in 1661. Before his death, he married Magdalen Carnegie, daughter of David Carnegie, styled Lord Carnegie (as son and heir apparent of the 1st Earl of Southesk) and Lady Margaret Hamilton (a daughter of the 1st Earl of Haddington).[19] Cornelius Crawfurd of Jordanhill was the closest relative, however Sir John's youngest daughter, Maragaret Crawfurd, inherited the estate of Kilbirnie. She married Hon. Patrick Lindsay (second son of the 17th Earl of Crawford).[19]\nIn 1810 John Crawfurd assumed the name Lindsay and claimed to be descended from the Hon. James Crawfurd, third son of the first Viscount Garnock. After much expense and deliberation the story was found to be entirely false and the claim rejected.[37] To add some credibility to the claim he had claimed that his forebear had been the eldest son and heir and had been forced to flee to Ireland after having murdered a man in a duel by firing before the signal. This duel he claimed had been over a matter of honour relating to the Lady Susanna Kennedy, later Countess of Eglinton, with whom he was entirely smitten.[38]\nThe Crawfurd-Pollocks of Pollok and Kilbirnie were granted a baronetcy that was extinct by 1885.[39]\nLindsay Crawfurds\nThe courtyard area and site of the old kitchen block.\nMargaret Crawfurd had been married to Patrick, second son of John, 15th Earl of Crawfurd and 1st of Lindsay. Her husband took the title and armorial bearings of Crawfurd of Kilburnie as per the entail to the estate.[36] The couple died only three days apart in 1680 from a malignant fever that also carried off her sister, Lady Blackhall, when she came down for the funeral. Records show that a significant number of mourners travelled down from Glasgow to the funeral.[40] The eldest son of their seven children, John, inherited in 1690. John Crawfurd became the commander of the Fencible men of Cuninghame in 1689 and in 1693 he was chosen as the Ayrshire member of the Scots Parliament. In 1705 he was created Viscount Mount Crawfurd (later changed to Viscount Garnock) by Queen Anne, and died in December 1708.[40] He married Margaret Stewart, daughter of the first Earl of Bute, and the couple had two sons and three daughters.[15] The line continued until George Lindsay Crawfurd inherited, the 20th Earl of Crawfurd, 6th Earl of Lindsay, and 4th Viscount Garnock, who died unmarried in 1808 and the estates passed to his sister, Lady Mary Lindsay Crawfurd who also died unmarried in 1833.[41][42]\nBoyles\nIn 1833 George Boyle, 4th Earl of Glasgow, inherited the ruins of the fire-gutted castle and house from Lady Mary Lindsay Crawfurd.[37] George was descended from Margaret, eldest daughter of Maragret Crawfurd and Patrick Lindsay, who had married David Boyle, 1st Earl of Glasgow.[42]\nKnoxs\nAt the break up of the Earl of Glasgow's estates the castle and lands were purchased by Sir James Knox.[42]\nPlace House\nKilbirnie Place, or Place House, was built between 1892 and 1894 for Sir James Knox. The house was designed by Henry Lord of Manchester. The building was demolished and only the outbuildings now survive.[2]\nSee also\nScotland portal\nBarony of Ladyland\nGiffordland\nGlengarnock Castle\nNether Mill\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\nBryden, Robert (1915).

    "text": "Lochranza Castle (May 2011)\nLochranza Castle (February 2004)\nLochranza Castle is an L-plan fortified tower house situated on a promontory in Lochranza, on the northern part of the Isle of Arran in Scotland. Most of the current structure was built in the 16th century.[1]\nHistory\nThe castle dates from the 13th century when it was owned by the MacSweens. In 1262, King Alexander III granted the castle and its lands to Walter Stewart, the Earl of Menteith.[2] It is believed that Robert the Bruce landed at Lochranza in 1306 on his return from Ireland to claim the Scottish throne.[2] By 1371, the castle was the property of Robert II.[2] It is thought that at this time it was used as a royal hunting lodge.\nDuring the 1490s, James IV used the castle in his campaign against the Lord of the Isles and the Clan MacDonald.[2]\nIn 1600 Robert Montgomerie of Skelmorlie recovered the castle for the Marquess of Hamilton from Alastair Mc Alastair and his followers.[3]\nIn 1614 it was occupied by the king and in the 1650s it was used by Oliver Cromwell.[2]\nBy 1705, Lochranza Castle was the property of the Hamilton family, after it was purchased by the Duchess of Hamilton.[4] The Hamiltons had owned other estates on the Isle of Arran so eventually sold it to the Blackwood-Davidson family who used it as their principal seat.[1] During the 18th century, the castle fell into disuse and was abandoned. The castle is now in the care of Historic Scotland.[4]\nLochranza Castle (August 2011)\nIn popular culture\nFor the album The Black Island in The Adventures of Tintin, Methuen Publishing, the English publisher, asked for more realism for the third edition of 1966. Bob de Moor, then Hergé's assistant, followed in Tintin's exact footsteps, drawing inspiration from different locations to produce a new set of background designs.[5] He goes to the Isle of Arran. According to Charles Dierick, a member of Studios Hergé, it erroneously follows that Lochranza Castle is said to serve as a model. But this one has a square tower and its silhouette is not appropriate, whereas on this same island Bob de Moor reproduces certain details of Brodick Castle.[6]\nThe castle appeared in \"Dom Joly and the Black Island\" on Channel 4 TV on 19 March 2010, in which it was portrayed as being Kisimul Castle on the Isle of Barra in the Outer Hebrides, as it appeared directly after Joly was shown attempting to reach Kisimul Castle.\nNotes\nExternal links\nHistoric Environment Scotland. \"Lochranza Castle,Arran (SM90206)\".\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Lochranza Castle.\n55°42′19″N 5°17′25″W / 55.7053°N 5.2903°W / 55.7053; -5.2903\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle and townhouse in Irvine, North Ayrshire, Scotland\nSeagate Castle is a castle and fortified town house in North Ayrshire, in the town of Irvine, close to the River Irvine, Scotland. The castle was formerly a stronghold, a town house, and later a dower house of the Montgomery Clan. The castle overlooks the oldest street in Irvine, which was once the main route between the town and the old harbour at Seagatefoot, which by 1606, was useless and abandoned due to silting. The remains of the castle are protected as a scheduled ancient monument.[1]\nHistory\nThe Royal Burgh\nEtymology\nThe meaning of Yrewin, c.1140; Irvin, c.1230; Orewin, c.1295 and Irewin, c.1429-30 may be 'west flowing river.'[2] 'Green river' as in the Welsh river named Irfon is also suggested. It has had many other variants, such as Irwyn, c.1322, Irrvin, c.1528, and Irwin, c.1537.[3] Paterson suggests 'clear river'.[4]\nThe first record of Irvine is in 1163, and the harbour at that time was near the sea-gait or Seagate, the castle being first built to protect it. Progressive silting was recorded by several early authors, who recorded that wind blowing the sand hindered the movement of ships, sometimes stranding them for several months.[5] Irvine was created a Royal Burgh by King Robert II in 1372[6] and this castle is the last of the town's old civil and ecclesiastical buildings to survive, the Carmelite friary,[7] tollbooth, chapel, bridge, and port having vanished without trace.\nThe castle\nSeagate Castle in the 1850s\nBenedict of Peterborough in 1184 records a castle of 'Hirun', which has been taken as referring to Irvine.[8] The original, probably-wooden castle tower or motte, was therefore built some time before 1184, being rebuilt in stone in the 1360s and then remodelled and expanded by Hugh the 3rd Earl of Eglinton, around 1565. Armorial panelling at the first floor hall level\nIn the twelfth century the castle of Irvine lay within the lordship of Cunninghame, which had been granted by David I to Hugh de Morville, Lord High Constable of Scotland. In 1196 the lordship passed from the de Morville family, through failure of male heirs, and then descended through various families, among whom were the Balliols. Robert the Bruce granted the lordship to Robert the Steward.[9]\nIn 1366 the castle passed into the possession of Sir Hugh de Eglintoun, along with the office of chamberlain of Irvine and bailie of the Barony of Cuninghame,[10] granted to him by Robert the Steward, High Steward of Scotland, later Robert II in this year. Sir Hugh, had married the Steward's half-sister, Egidia, by which marriage he had an only child, Elizabeth. Elizabeth de Eglintoun, as sole heiress, married John Montgomerie of Eaglesham, to whom the estates and possessions passed, including the barony of Ardrossan.[9] Masons marks, door jambs, face carving, etc. at Seagate Castle\nSeagate Castle, probably the third castle in Irvine's historical timeline, is not a typical town lodging, having some of the characteristics of a castle or fortalice, built as a showpiece between 1562–85,[11] in style more a palace, place, or mansion house.\nMontgomerie Coat of Arms of the late seventeenth century\nThe castle is thought by some to incorporate the remnants of the strong twelfth-century castle of 'Irewin', described as being a stronghold of some strength in 1184, however, this has not been verified.[10] The triangular tower in the north-west corner has been suggested as having been part of this earlier castle.[10]\nThe earliest representation of Seagate Castle was drawn by John Ainslie and is to be found in the Eglinton Estate Book.[12]\nIn 1945 Seagate Castle was given to the Burgh of Irvine by Mrs. Walker of Castlepark.[13]\nIrvine Development Corporation (IDC) funded a trial excavation in October 1992 to locate the medieval castle. It revealed mediaeval deposits to a depth of 2.8m. and a short length of wall, however, no clear dating evidence was unearthed.[14]\nThe three panelled armorial panel may have carried the full conjoined arms at the top and the standard coat of arms of Montgomerie and Drummond at the bottom.\nConstables\nSeagate castle was held by a Constable on behalf of the lord; Irvine muniments records show that Philip de Horssey was constable as son-in-law to Richard de Morville; between 1391 and 1425 the post was held by Thomas de Vauce; in 1428 John de Brakanrig inherited the post through his wife; in 1438 Thomas Spark held the post and sold lands and the post of constable to William Cunningham of Craigends. An annual payment of two merks had been made throughout this time and this ceased with the post's demise in 1596.[15]\nArchitecture\nThe entrance doorway is of the Scottish Renaissance Gothic style, and the building, less defensive and more an elegant mansion, has elegant moulded windows and other ornate embellishments.[16] The castle is entered through a vaulted pend running through the north section of the main block, which has a fine ornamental arched doorway, opening into the courtyard and having similarities with the southern entrance passageway at Linlithgow Palace.[17] A lengthy main block faces the street, to the east of this three towers projected, two were round and one was triangular; probably because of the lie of the land. It has been suggested that this tower is of a much older construction, but other authorities dispute this. A small guardroom and a prison pit may have existed in this area.[17] Detail of the entrance doorway\nDetail of the old watchtower overlooking the old harbour\nThe south half of the long main block and one round tower now are reduced to the basement and foundations, but the remainder is fairly entire as far as the wallhead. The courtyard with a curtain wall and subsidiary building existed to the east. The ground floor is fairly complete with vaulted accommodation, with two guard rooms, each having a single door; a typical defensive precaution of the time.[17] The kitchen and fireplace survive, as do the two principal rooms to the south, the southernmost of which was the only room to connect with the upper floor; a private stair leading up from it to what was probably the great hall.[17][18] The kitchen has an arch, a large window, and aumbries, together with a serving hatch in the adjoining passageway.[17] The upper floors, with their fireplaces and fine moulded windows, were reached via the round tower entered from the courtyard.[17]\nThe ornate entrance off Seagate has attracted some debate as to its origin, being visually more ecclesiastical than baronial in appearance, variously described as 'Saxon', 'Norman', or 'Scottish Gothic' in style. McGibbon and Ross were of the opinion that the doorway is quite typical of sixteenth and seventeenth century Scottish Renaissance Gothic work as found in several collegiate and parish churches and not necessarily Norman in origin.[19] Kilwinning Abbey was being sacked and progressively demolished at this time and stonework may have been removed to build this doorway and also used for the building of the rest of the structure. The Romanesque mouldings at Seagate have been compared with similar work, circa 1573, found at Blairquhan (old) Castle, possibly Maybole, and several other West of Scotland castles.[20]\nA cesspool was conveniently, but unhygienically located just outside the back door of the kitchen in the courtyard, with a channel running to it from the fireplace. Other pipes linked to this channel from garderobes upstairs.[18] A good number of different mason's marks are located on the stonework in the entrance pend and elsewhere. The building may have been harled, a form of roughcast.\nSmugglers and destruction\nInterior of the 'ancient tower'\nAfter being unroofed in around 1746, Seagate ceased to be inhabited by family retainers, however, the Castle became the haunt of smugglers, thieves and beggars. After nightfall the locals shunned it, and if any property was stolen in the town it was the first place to be searched. In the 1800s people still living could remember seeing the smugglers' \" wee still \" sitting in the large kitchen fireplace producing illicit spirits.[9]\nLocals extensively quarried the building for their own purposes, however in 1810, Earl Hugh (the 12th Earl) made extensive repairs to the building, blocking up the windows, doors, etc. In 1839 a great storm caused considerable collapse of stones into the courtyard. When inspected in 1883 the vaults, kitchen, and other apartments, were found full of rubble, soil, and rubbish of all kinds, much of which was the refuse chiefly of adjoining properties. The Earl of Eglinton had this all removed, which took about a month, the debris being buried in the Low Green.[9][21]\nIn 2010 the building, although still roofless and ruinous, exhibits the high status of its former status as a town house; council minutes record that some restoration works were carried out by Enterprise Ayrshire in the 1990s,[22] the town council having had some repairs carried out in 1971.[23]\nThe Montgomeries\nThe coat of arms of the Montgomerie and Drummond families\nThe Montgomerie family may have built the castle as their town house and as a jointure house for the dowager countesses.[24] The coat of arms of one owner, probably the builder, Hugh Montgomerie, 3rd Earl of Eglinton, are on a roof boss in the entrance pend, together with his 'HM' initials and the arms of his wife, Agnes Drummond, with 'AD' incised; he married her in 1562. Sir Hugh he died in 1585.[16]\nLove gives Hugh's wife's name as Margaret Drummond of Innerpeffray;[24] however, a Dame Agnes Drummond (Lady Loudoun) was the daughter of Sir John Drummond of Innerpeffray[25] and widow of Sir Hugh Campbell of Loudoun. Hugh had previously married, Lady Jean Hamilton, a daughter of the Earl of Arran, however, this ended in a divorce in 1562.[26]\nOver the centuries Seagate Castle, the Garden, or Easter Chambers in Kilwinning,[27] Kilmaurs House, Auchans Castle, and Redburn House all have been used as dower houses by the family.\nAbandonment\nSeagate Castle was inhabited until approximately 1746 when its roof was removed by the Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton (1723–1769) and used in the construction of a new church in Ardrossan parish that the earl was building;[24] Pocoke on his journeys through Scotland in 1760, visited Irvine and described the castle as ruinous.[25][28]\nMary Queen of Scots and Marymass\nLady Mary of Eglinton on the Montgomerie family crest\nThe commemorative plaque on the castle wall\nIt is recorded on the plaque at the entrance that Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed at the castle in 1563.[29] The 3rd earl was a great supporter and he is said to have entertained the queen and her four Marys; Mary Seton; Mary Beaton; Mary Fleming; and Mary Livingston at the castle.[16][24] This visit to the castle is said to be the origin of the town’s Marymass celebrations, held in August of each year; however, it is more likely that Marymass has its origins in the dedication of the church to the Blessed Virgin Mary whose festival of Assumption is on 15 August. Saint Inan's festival was on 18 August.[30] It has even been suggested that the festival was named after Lady Mary of Eglinton, from the family crest, who decapitated a Viking who had tried to kidnap her. This one of several versions of the story.[31]\nIn the 1880s at the Marymass Fair, the carters, freemasons, and others on their return from the parade on the racecourse, came back via the Seagate, stopped and arranged themselves in front of the old Castle to sing \" Auld Lang Syne.\"[9][31] The Carter's continue that tradition to this day.\nTreaty of Irvine\nThe memorial to the Scottish Army Campsite at Knadgerhill; a battle that never happened\nThe castle information plaque records that the 'Treaty of Irvine' between Scotland and England was signed at Seagate Castle on 9 July 1297; this would have been in the earlier castle. In 1297 Edward I had sent a punitive expedition under Sir Henry Percy to Irvine to quash an armed uprising against his dethronement of John Balliol. The Earl of Carrick, Robert Bruce, Bishop Wishart and others led the Scottish army, however, after much argument they decided to submit without a fight. The armies had been encamped in sight of each other, the English at Tarryholme and the Scots at Knadgerhill, with the old Trindlemoss or Scotts Loch between them.[32] Rodolph de Eglinton is said to have hosted the negotiations at Seagate Castle. The Bruce never accepted the surrender conditions and Edward I did not confirm it.[33]\nThe story became embellished with a purely fanciful involvement of William Wallace in a brave action here.[34] The original treaty survives and is to be found in the Public Record Office, London. Through this treaty certain of the Scottish leaders submitted to the English; the treaty also is known as the 'Capitulation of Irvine'.\nMajor General Robert Montgomerie\nRobert Montgomerie was a son of the sixth Earl and lived in Irvine,[35] probably at the Seagate Castle townhouse. In February 1682 an odd case of witchcraft occurred in the general's household. An Irish serving-maid was accused of stealing some silverware, however, she declared herself to be innocent and in a fit of anger offered to raise the Devil, who would reveal the identity of the real thief. She was not taken seriously, however, she set about this task, entering the cellar and drawing a circle around herself and performing a complex ritual with a Bible, riddle, and a black cock's feathers. The result was that she conjured up the Devil and obtained the details of the theft. The silverware was duly located, however, the General reported her to the authorities who imprisoned her in the Irvine tolbooth.\nShe admitted having learnt the ritual from a Dr. Colvin in Ireland, a man skilled in the use of medicinal herbs and incantations. Her ultimate fate is not recorded.[36][37] Whilst the ritual was being performed the general and his wife had been struck with an inexplicable sense terror and the dogs of the town had been barking in fear.[38]\nViews of Seagate Castle The castle from the East A view from the North Windows looking onto Seagate The East guardroom\nMicro-history\nSeagate was found to be in danger of partial collapse in 2010 and in 2011 North Ayrshire Council carried out repair works to consolidate the structure of the castle.\nGeorge Gemmell of Craigfoot was a notable royalist prosecutor of the Covenanters; he is said to have lived at Seagate Castle in the seventeenth century.[15]\nThe Earls of Eglinton also had a house called Castlepark in Eglinton Street.[39]\nLey tunnels are said to run from Seagate Castle to Stanecastle and to Dundonald Castle.[15]\nIn 1859 the crowds at the Robert Burns Centenary celebrations had sung 'Auld Lang Syne' outside the castle walls.[31]\nCastle details from 1890 The Seagate Castle entrance doorway Window and armorial panelling over the entrance doorway Seagate Castle from the north-east Seagate's first floor plan\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\nBlair, Anna (1983).

    "text": "Palace in Kirkwall, Scotland\nThe Bishop's Palace, Kirkwall is a 12th-century palace built at the same time as the adjacent St Magnus Cathedral in the centre of Kirkwall, Orkney, Scotland. It housed the cathedral's first bishop, William the Old of the Norwegian Catholic Church who took his authority from the Archbishop of Nidaros (Trondheim). The ruined structure now looks like a small castle.\nHistory\nOriginally, it is thought to have been like a typical Royal Norwegian palace, with a large rectangular hall above store rooms and a tower house as the Bishop's private residence. King Haakon IV of Norway, overwintering after the Battle of Largs, died here in 1263, marking the end of Norse rule over the Outer Hebrides. The neglected palace had fallen into ruins by 1320.[1]\nIn 1468, Orkney and Shetland were pledged by Christian I of Denmark and Norway for the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret, betrothed to James III of Scotland, and as the money has never since been paid, their connection with the crown of Scotland has been perpetual. In 1526, the palace came briefly into the possession of William, Lord Sinclair, before he was ordered to return it to the Bishop of Orkney. When King James V of Scotland visited Kirkwall in 1540, he garrisoned his troops in the palace and in Kirkwall Castle. Soon afterwards, extensive restoration was begun by Bishop Robert Reid, the last of Orkney's medieval bishops, who also founded the University of Edinburgh. Reid added a round tower, the Moosie Toor.[2]\nMary I of England sent a fleet to Scotland in 1557, commanded by William Woodhouse and John Clere. Clere's troops attacked the cathedral on 12 August. The force was overpowered on the next day while attempting to capture the Bishop's Palace. Many of the retreating English, including Clere, drowned trying to reach their ships.[3]\nOwnership passed to Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney, in 1568, then to his son Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney who planned to incorporate it into his Earl's Palace, Kirkwall, but debts forced him to return it to Bishop James Law. Earl Patrick's son Robert seized both palaces in 1614, and a siege followed, though it is not known if this caused damage to the structures, both of which are now ruins.[4]\nToday\nThe palace is open to the public. It is administered by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.[5]\nThe palace and the nearby Earl's Palace are closed to the public October 2023 - March 2024 during which time high level masonry inspections are being carried out as part of the building's conservation.[6]\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Bishop's Palace.\nHistoric Environment Scotland: Visitor guide\nOrkneyjar - The Bishop's Palace, Kirkwall\n58°58′51″N 2°57′35″W / 58.98083°N 2.95972°W / 58.98083; -2.95972\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Ruins of a 12th century castle on the island of Wyre, Orkney, Scotland\nCobbie Row's Castle\nCobbie Row's (or Cubbie Roo's) Castle is the oldest medieval castle known to exist in Scotland. The castle ruins are located on the island of Wyre in Orkney. Built in the mid-12 century by Norse landowner, Kolbeinn hrúga, the stone fortification originally consisted of a small, central tower set in an oval enclosure, surrounded by two ditches, a stone wall and an earthen rampart. Historic Environment Scotland established the site as a scheduled monument in 1929. Description\nThe remains of the early medieval stone fort sits on a low hill on the island of Wyre in Orkney, Scotland. The earliest building on the site is the small tower, measuring approximately 8 m (26 ft) square and has remaining walls that are 2.34 m (7 ft 8 in) in height and are approximately 2 m (6 ft 7 in) thick. The ground floor is the only surviving floor in the tower, and was constructed with coursed rubble. A narrow ledge on the north wall, originally used to support joists on the first floor, is also visible. It is believed that interior ladders were used to gain access to the first floor, since there is no ground floor doorway. The ground floor was most likely used for storage supplies. It originally contained a water tank that also may have been used to store live fish. The tank was cut into solid rock.[1][2][3]\nThe tower stands on a platform and was surrounded by an oval enclosure of two ditches, a stone wall and an embankment. The main entrance to the enclosure lay to the east, across a bridge made of flagstone. The remaining outer defenses are to the north, west and east of the tower. Defenses south of the tower have disappeared under later extensions. Excavation of the site has revealed that there were five phases of improvements and additions to the castle complex, with initial changes occurring in the 13th century. Changes included extensions to the tower and outer domestic structures. The north extension consists of a fireplace and an oven. [1][3][4]\nHistory\nThe late 12th century chronicle, the Orkneyinga Saga, tells of a Norwegian landowner named Kolbein hrúga, who built a 'fine stone castle\" (steinkastala) on the island of Wyre around 1145 AD. The mid-13th century biography of King Haakon IV of Norway, Hagonar Saga, describes the castle as difficult to attack during a siege in 1231.[3] The name, \"Cobbie Row\", is an alteration of Kolbein Hruga's Norse nickname, \"Kobbie\" or \"Kubbie\". \"Row\" (or \"Roo\") is adapted from his second name, \"hrúga\". The castle has been also referred to as \"Cubbie Roo\", \"Cubbie Row\", and \"Cobbie Roo\".[1]\nCobbie Row's Castle is believed to be the oldest medieval castle in Scotland.[1] At the bottom of the hill where the castle stands, are the ruins of St. Mary's Chapel. The chapel was probably built by Hrúga or his son, Bjarni Kolbeinsson, Bishop of Orkney during the mid to late 12th century.[4] The site of the castle and nearby chapel suggest that the island of Wyre was a powerful and prosperous Norse estate during the medieval era.[1][3]\nHistoric Environment Scotland established the site as a scheduled monument in 1929.[2]\nGallery Aerial view of Cobbie Row's Castle and below, St. Mary's Chapel Ruins of Cobbie Row's Castle Interior of Cobbie Row's Castle See also\nBishop's Palace, Kirkwall The Norse settlement at Jarlshof, Shetland Islands\nReferences\n59°07′12″N 2°58′36″W / 59.11992°N 2.97663°W / 59.11992; -2.97663 <img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Country house in Blair Atholl, Perth and Kinross, Scotland, UK\nBlair Castle (in Scottish Gaelic: Caisteil Bhlàir) stands in its grounds near the village of Blair Atholl in Perthshire in Scotland. It is the ancestral home of the Clan Murray, and was historically the seat of their chief, the Duke of Atholl, though the current chief, the 12th Duke of Atholl, lives in South Africa, where he was born and raised. The castle stands in Glen Garry, and commands a strategic position on the main route (now the A9 road) through the central Scottish Highlands.\nThe castle is a category A listed building,[1] and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens.[2]\nHistory\nMurray Heraldry.\nBlair Castle is said to have been started in 1269 by John I Comyn, Lord of Badenoch (died c. 1275), a northern neighbour of David I Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl (died 1270), who started building on the Earl's land while he was away on crusade. Upon his return, the Earl complained about the interloper to King Alexander III, won back his land, and incorporated the tower that had been built into his own castle. David II Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl (died 1326), forfeited the titles and estates after rebelling against King Robert the Bruce in 1308, and the King granted them to Niall mac Cailein. The earldom was granted to a number of individuals over the years until 1457 when James II granted it to his half-brother John Stewart (1440–1512). John Murray, son of the second Earl of Tullibardine, was created Earl of Atholl in 1629, and the title has since remained in the Murray family.\nDuring the Wars of the Three Kingdoms of the 17th century, the Murrays supported the Royalist cause, which led to Blair Castle being taken by Oliver Cromwell's army following his invasion of 1650. The restored Charles II created the title Marquess of Atholl for John Murray, 2nd Earl of Atholl (1631–1703). The title Duke of Atholl was granted to the 2nd Marquess in 1703.\nWhen Viscount Dundee launched the first Jacobite rising in April 1689, Atholl decided to remain loyal to the Government (although two of his sons joined the Jacobites). Atholl's factor, Patrick Stewart of Ballechin, held Blair Castle for King James, and Dundee visited in May. In July Ballechin refused entry to Atholl's whiggish son and heir, Lord John Murray. Murray laid siege to the castle, and General Mackay was approaching to join him and to seize it for the Williamites. Viscount Dundee relieved the castle, and the crucial Battle of Killiecrankie was fought because Dundee did not want to retreat and surrender the castle to Mackay. Dundee and his officers and clan chiefs held a Council of War at the castle on the eve of the battle, on 26 July. The next day, the Jacobites won the battle but Dundee was killed.\nAfter the battle, Blair Castle remained in Jacobite hands for some time. It continued to play an important role: for example, the Jacobite Highland chiefs swore a bond there together in August, to continue the rising.\nIn the Forty-Five, Blair Castle was occupied twice by Prince Charles Edward Stuart and his Jacobite army: in early September 1745, for several days, and then in early February 1746, again for several days. However, the Jacobites then unwisely abandoned it and Government forces, including Lowland Clan Agnew then occupied it. They held Blair Castle against the Jacobites, who laid siege to the castle during the last stages of the rising, in March 1746 they were besieged to near starvation until the Jacobite forces withdrew to fight the British Government forces at the Battle of Culloden.\nThe castle sometime before 1908\nIn 1844 Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert, visited and stayed at Blair Castle. It was after this she gave permission to establish the Atholl Highlanders.\nPart of the castle was converted to a hospital during the First World War; poet Hamish Henderson's mother had worked there as a nurse on her return from France.[3]\nBefore his death in February 1996, the 10th Duke of Atholl placed Blair Castle and most of his estates in a charitable trust, shielding them from inheritance taxes and leaving them under Scottish control, as his heir John Murray, the 11th Duke, had indicated he had no desire to leave his native South Africa.[4] His half-nephew Robert Troughton was the heir to the remaining estate.[5]\nOn the night of 10 March 2011 a fire broke out at the clock tower of castle (not part of the medieval fabric), causing the tower's roof and second floor to collapse into the first floor.[6] The clock tower was restored in 2012, with restoration work on the clock mechanisms performed by Smith of Derby Group.\nThe castle and gardens\nThe oldest part of the castle is the six-storey Cummings or Comyn's Tower, which may retain some 13th-century fabric, though it was largely built in the 15th century. The extensions which now form the central part of the castle were first added in the 16th century. The apartments to the south were added in the mid-18th century to designs by architects John Douglas and James Winter. The south-east range, incorporating the clock tower, was rebuilt by Archibald Elliot after a fire in 1814. Finally, the castle arrived at its present form in the 1870s, when David Bryce remodelled the whole building for the 7th Duke of Atholl in a Scots Baronial style, and added the ballroom.[1] It was further remodelled in 1885 when a new ballroom wing was added by James Campbell Walker.[7]\nDuring the Great War the castle was used as an auxiliary hospital and after 1922 the family found it more convenient to live in the private apartments.[8] The castle has been open to the public since 1936.[9] Its many rooms feature important collections of weapons, hunting trophies, souvenirs of the Murray clan, ethnographica, paintings, furniture, and needlework collected by the Murray family over many generations.[10] Angela Murray who was a director of the Pearson Group was involved in helping to manage the estate[9] and her portrait is at the castle. Her daughter, Sarah Troughton, in 2024 was the chair of the trustees.[11]\nThe castle also provides the garrison for the Atholl Highlanders, the private army of the Duke of Atholl, noted as the only legal private army in Europe. The Castle and the Atholl Estates were used in the 2008 reality television series Conquer the Castle.\nMost Dukes of Atholl are buried in the family burial ground (photo) next to the ruins of St Bride's Kirk in the grounds of Blair Castle. St Bride's was the village church of Old Blair but fell into disuse after 1823 when the estate village was relocated to its current location.[12]\nIn 2009, a Grand Fir (Abies grandis) in Diana's Grove in the grounds of the castle, was measured at 62.7 metres (206 ft), and declared the second-tallest tree in Britain.[13]\nGallery\nBlair castle, exterior and interiors views The castle's gate lodge, a Category A listed structure The entrance avenue to Blair Castle.

It overlooks Strath Earn.\nThe earliest known owner of the castle was Sir William Oliphant in the late 13th century.[1] The Battle of Dupplin Moor took place in the vicinity in 1332, when it was won by Edward Baliol.[2] The castle was destroyed in 1461 and rebuilt.[1] Dupplin was sold after some four hundred years by the 5th Lord Oliphant (who, per the diploma registered under the Great Seal, 10 March 1640, was also Lord Aberdalgie and Lord Dupplin) in 1623. It fell into the Hay family, after it was granted to Charles I's Lord Chancellor, the 1st Earl of Kinnoull.\n[2] It was again rebuilt in 1688, though retained its earlier tower and some remnants of the earlier castle. In 1729 the estate was relandscaped including infilling of a deep precipice between two hills.[3]\nA fire gutted the castle in 1827, prompting a full rebuilding and restoration.[1]\nThe castle was rebuilt as a country house under architect William Burn in 1828–32 at a cost of roughly £30,000.[2] In 1911 it was purchased by whisky baron Sir John Dewar, who was ennobled as Lord Forteviot of Dupplin five years later. In the 1920s or 1930s there was a fire in the interior.[1][2] It was demolished in August–October 1967.[1] A new house was built in 1970 on the foundations.[2]\nReferences\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Dupplin Castle.\n56°21′30″N 3°31′44″W / 56.3582°N 3.5288°W / 56.3582; -3.5288\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Perth and Kinross, Scotland\nLochleven Castle is a ruined castle on an island in Loch Leven, in the Perth and Kinross local authority area of Scotland. Possibly built around 1300, the castle was the site of military action during the Wars of Scottish Independence (1296–1357). In the latter part of the 14th century, the castle was granted to William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, by his uncle. It remained in the Douglases' hands for the next 300 years. Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned there in 1567–68, and forced to abdicate as queen, before escaping with the help of her gaoler's family. In 1588, the queen's gaoler inherited the title of Earl of Morton, and moved away from the castle. In 1675, Sir William Bruce, an architect, bought the castle and used it as a focal point for his garden; it was never again used as a residence.\nThe remains of the castle are protected as a scheduled monument in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.[1] Lochleven Castle is open to the public in summer, and access is available by ferry.\nHistory\nEarly history\nA castle may have been built on Castle Island as early as 1257, when King Alexander III of Scotland, then 16 years old, was forcibly brought there by his regents.[2] During the First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328), the invading English army held the castle, then named Lochleven Castle; it lies at a strategically important position between the towns of Edinburgh, Stirling and Perth. Part of the present fortification, the curtain wall, may date from this time period [3] and may have been built by the occupying English.[4] The castle was captured by the Scots before the end of the 13th century, possibly by the forces of William Wallace.[5]\nEnglish forces laid siege to Lochleven in 1301, but the garrison was relieved in the same year when the siege was broken by Sir John Comyn.[5] King Robert the Bruce (reigned 1306–1329) is known to have visited the castle in 1313 and again in 1323.[4] Following Bruce's death, the English invaded again, and in 1335 laid siege to Lochleven Castle in support of the pretender Edward Balliol (d. 1364).[5] According to the 14th-century chronicle of John of Fordun, the English attempted to flood the castle by building a dam across the outflow of the loch; the water level rose, but after a month the captain of the English force, Sir John de Stirling, left the area to attend the festival of Saint Margaret of Scotland, and the defenders, under Alan de Vipont, took advantage of his absence to come out of the castle under cover of night, and damage the dam, causing it to collapse and flood the English camp. However, this account has been doubted by later historians.[6]\nLoch Leven Castle was fortified in the 14th or early-15th century by the addition of a five-storey tower house or keep.[3] According to Historic Scotland, it was built in the 14th century, making it one of the oldest tower houses in Scotland that still substantially survives.[4] In 1390, King Robert II (reigned 1371–1390) granted the castle to Sir Henry Douglas, the husband of his niece Marjory.[7] Beginning in the 14th century, the castle served as a state prison. Several notable men were imprisoned there, including Robert II in 1369 (before he became king),[4] Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas (d. 1439), early in the 15th century, and Patrick Graham, the Archbishop of St Andrews, in 1478 (who died in captivity there).[2]\nMary, Queen of Scots, Escaping from Lochleven Castle (1805) by William Craig Shirreff.\n16th century\nMary, Queen of Scots (reigned 1542–1567), stayed at Lochleven for a week in May 1562 to recover after she fell from her horse while riding out from Falkland Palace,[8][9] In April 1563, she had an interview there with the Calvinist preacher John Knox.[10]\nIn June 1565, Mary stayed at Perth, at Ruthven Castle, and Innerpeffray Castle.[11] It was said the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Argyll plotted to capture her and Lord Darnley as they returned to Edinburgh riding by Loch Leven.[12] Mary would have been imprisoned in Lochleven Castle and Darnley taken to Castle Campbell to prevent their marriage.[13]\nIn September 1565, Mary visited Loch Leven again as the guest of Sir William Douglas of Lochleven (d. 1606).[14] Two years later, Mary returned to Lochleven as a prisoner. She was held there from 17 June 1567 until her escape on 2 May 1568.[15] She had been imprisoned there after the Battle of Carberry Hill on 15 June, when she surrendered to her noblemen, who opposed her marriage to the Earl of Bothwell. She was taken to Lochleven and given into the custody of Sir William Douglas of Lochleven. For most of her captivity she lived in Glassin Tower (built in the early 16th century), at the south-east corner of the castle. Some of William Douglas's daughters slept in her bedchamber for extra security.[16]\nThe household included Sir William's mother Lady Margaret Douglas (mother of Mary's half-brother the Earl of Moray), his brother George Douglas, and Willie Douglas (a young orphaned relative).[17] Mary later wrote that her own servants at Lochleven included only two women, a cook, and a surgeon or doctor.[18]\nMary fell ill on her arrival, which was suspected to be the result of a deliberate poisoning, and sometime before 24 July she miscarried twins that she had conceived with Bothwell; they were hastily buried in the grounds.[19] She was probably nursed back to health by Agnes Leslie.[20] Only a few days later she was forced to abdicate as Queen of Scots in favour of her infant son James.[21] William Maitland of Lethington and Mary Fleming sent her a gold jewel depicting the lion and mouse of Aesop's fable.[22] This was a token alluding to the possibility of escape, and his continuing support for her, the mouse could free the lion by nibbling away the knots of the net. Mary wore the jewel at the castle and Marie Courcelles, one of her women and sometimes described as her French chamberer, provided a description.[23] For a time, Mary was moved into the main tower, considered easier to guard at night than her first lodging.[24]\nMary recovered during the autumn and winter, and gradually won George Douglas over to her own cause.[25] A contemporary wrote that George was \"in fantasy of love wythe hir.\"[26] Mary asked her servant Servais de Condé to send her materials for textile projects and embroidery. She also made multiple attempts to escape. Once, she pretended to be a laundress, while one of her ladies took her place inside the castle.[27] However, as she was leaving, the boatman who was taking her across the loch recognized her, and took her back to the castle.[28] Another time, she planned to escape by scaling the 7-foot (2.1 m) wall outside the castle, but one of her ladies-in-waiting, Jane Kennedy, injured herself while they were practising the escape.[29] On the night she finally successfully escaped, she dressed as a servant,[30] Willie Douglas stole the keys, and Marie Courcelles let her walk out of the castle. She was then rowed across the loch to where George Douglas was waiting for her, along with 200 horsemen, and they fled to Niddry Castle in Lothian.[29][31] Three days after, her French cook Estienne Hauet and his wife Elles Boug packed her silk and velvet gowns and other items in a chest to send to Mary wherever she might be.[32]\nOld keys found when the level of the loch was lowered in the 19th-century are said to be those taken by Willie Douglas.[33] The castle is one of many in Scotland said to be haunted by Mary's spirit because she is waiting for her twins to return to her so they would know their loss of life was not her fault; the sadness she felt about their loss kept her trapped within the castle walls after her death.[34] The English Earl of Northumberland was also held here, after offending Elizabeth I of England.[35] He was confined at Loch Leven for two years before being sent back to England to be executed.[36] In 1588, when Sir William Douglas of Lochleven succeeded to the earldom of Morton as the 6th earl,[7] he inherited other properties along with the title, including Aberdour Castle in Fife, and as a result Loch Leven Castle became less frequently used.\nSir William Bruce\nLooking across fields of oilseed rape to Loch Leven Castle\nFrom around 1546, Margaret Erskine and her son William Douglas built a house on the shore of the Loch which was known as \"Newhouse\"[37] The \"Newhouse\" replaced the island castle as the legal centre of the estate in 1619.[38] On 12 May 1589, William Douglas, now 6th Earl of Morton, entertained the Danish Admiral Peder Munk at the Newhouse. He had been to Falkland Palace taking possession of the property as part of the king's \"morning gift\" to his bride Anne of Denmark.[39]\nIn 1675, the Loch Leven estate was bought from the Douglases by Sir William Bruce (c.1630–1710), royal architect in Scotland. Bruce built nearby Kinross House on the loch shore from 1686, aligning the principal axis of house and garden on the distant castle. The \"Newhouse\", which was finally demolished in 1723, was just to the north of Bruce's site. Kinross was one of the first buildings in the classical style erected in Scotland. Thereafter Lochleven Castle was no longer used as a dwelling, but it was preserved by Bruce as a picturesque focus for his gardens.[5]\nRecent years\nLochleven Castle had fallen into ruin by the 18th century,[40] but the ruins were conserved and rubbish removed in 1840.[41] The estate passed from the Bruces to the Graham family in the 18th century and then, in the 19th century, to the Montgomerys, who no longer occupy Kinross House.[42]\nLochleven Castle was given in to state care in 1939, and is now managed by Historic Environment Scotland.[5] Today, the castle can be reached by a 12-person ferry operated from Kinross during the summer months.[43] The remains of the castle are protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[1]\nDescription\nGround floor plan of Loch Leven Castle\nThe castle, and an outer enclosure of which little trace remains, originally took up almost the entire area of Castle Island. The present wooded, and considerably larger, island was formed in the early 19th century when the canalising of the outflow of the River Leven, which enters the Firth of Forth at the town of Leven, led to a substantial lowering of the water level.\nThe castle comprises a rectangular courtyard surrounded by a curtain wall, with a tower house, or keep, at one corner, and the round Glassin Tower projecting from the opposite corner. The foundations of demolished ranges of buildings remain around two sides of the courtyard. Of the outer court, only an earth bank shows the position of the walls, with fragmentary remains of a bakehouse the only visible structures.\nTower house\nThe tower house, or keep, at the west corner of the enclosure, measures 36.5 feet (11.1 m) by 31.5 feet (9.6 m) and originally had five storeys, although the roof and timber floors are now gone.[3] The lowest level is a vaulted basement, with a vaulted kitchen above. The hall was on the next floor, with chambers above, all linked by a spiral stair.\nGlassin Tower\nThe Glassin Tower is a round tower that was built into the south-east corner of the ancient curtain wall, probably around 1550. The derivation of 'Glassin' is unknown. The purpose of the tower was to provide additional accommodation and to give the castle a more imposing appearance. Gunholes that allowed fire to be directed along the external face of the curtain wall improved defence. The tower has a vaulted basement for storing water, accessed separately from the courtyard. The basement has separate channels to allow water to be collected from the loch and waste water to be drained through a slop-drain. The lower chamber has an oriel window which would have given views over the loch. The upper chamber served as a bedchamber. At the very top a small room, accessible only from the wall walk, was possibly a study or library.[44]\nArchaeological findings\nA minor excavation in 1995 found the footings and two steps of a stone stairway that provided access to the Great Hall of the tower. 16th-century pottery and animal bones were found in 0.75 metres (2.5 ft) of debris near the forestair.[3]\nNotes\nReferences\nCoventry, Martin.

    "text": "Castle in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, UK\nPerth Castle was a 9th-century castle in Perth, Scotland.[1] It was located near the northern end of today's Skinnergate. In the 19th century, there was a memorial to the castle in Castle Gable, which ran north-west from the castle's former location,[2][3] today occupied by Perth Concert Hall.\nHistory\nThe Danes attacked the castle in the 9th century. A motte-and-bailey castle was built in the 12th century. The castle was once a royal residence. King Malcolm IV of Scotland was besieged at the castle in 1160 by Ferchar, Earl of Strathearn, and five other earls. A flood in 1209 damaged the castle and it became the residence of the Scottish Kings after the destruction of the Royal Palace in 1210.[2] A further flood in 1290 damaged the motte mound and required the castle to be rebuilt. The castle was surrendered to the English in 1296. After it reverted to Scottish control, King Edward I of England captured the castle in 1298, 1300 and 1303. Besieged in 1306 and 1309 by Scottish forces, it withheld the sieges. It was captured in 1309 by Scottish forces and then by English forces in 1311. On 8 January 1313, the castle was captured by King Robert I of Scotland, who ordered the walls and castle to be destroyed. This was done to prevent the castle being used again by English forces garrisoning the castle against Scotland. Nothing remains above ground.[2]\nSee also\nGowrie House\nSpey Tower\nReferences\nFurther reading\nCoventry, Martin (1997). The Castles of Scotland (2nd ed.). Edinburgh: Goblinshead. pp. 277–278.

    "text": "Blackhall Manor after restoration\nBlackhall Manor is a tower house in Paisley in Renfrewshire, in the western central Lowlands of Scotland. It dates to the sixteenth century, although parts may be older, and formerly belonged to the Stewart or Shaw-Stewart family. It was designated as a Category B listed building in 1971.[1][2][3]\nHistory\nThe first house on the site was built by the Norman knight Walter fitz Alan in about 1160. In 1396 Robert III of Scotland, King of Scots, gave the property to Sir John Stewart, his natural son.[3] According to a record book now lost, barony courts were regularly held there in the sixteenth century.[3] In 1667 Archibald Stewart was made a Baronet of Nova Scotia by Charles II, and was the first baronet of Greenock and Blackhall.[3]\nBy the 1820s Blackhall had become a farm-house; in the 1840s the farmer built a new house nearby, and the roof of the old one was taken off to save on tax. The structure was used as a store-house, a cattle byre and a coal shed. The Shaw-Stewart family donated it to the Burgh of Paisley in 1940. In 1978 it was judged to have become so dangerous that demolition was proposed.[3] It was completely rebuilt and restored in 1982–1983.[1]\nNo information about the evolution of the tower over the centuries is available, but the presence of a 14th-century fireplace jamb, the different style of windows in the staircase tower from the rest of the building and its relatively poor bonding with the main block suggest that the tower house was originally built as a hall house and enlarged in the 16th century with the addition of another storey and attic, stair tower, larger windows and a new ground-floor entrance. More windows were added in the late 16th or early 17th centuries.[3]\nSee also\nList of listed buildings in Paisley, Renfrewshire\nStewart, later Shaw-Stewart baronets, of Greenock and Blackhall\nReferences\nFurther reading\nThe Place of Blackhall – the Story of Eight Centuries,\" Janet S.

    "text": "Castle in Renfrewshire, Scotland, UK\nRenfrew Castle was situated at the royal burgh of Renfrew, Scotland, which is near the confluence of the River Clyde and the River Cart. The original 12th-century castle was built by Walter fitz Alan, upon a river islet known as the King's Inch. This was replaced in the 13th century with a new castle by the road to the Clyde ferry, which became a royal castle under King Robert II. In the 15th century, the King's Inch site was rebuilt as Inch Castle by Sir John Ross. Both castles were demolished in the 18th century and nothing remains above ground at either site.\nHistory\n12th century castle\nThe King's Inch was formerly an island in the River Clyde, and was among the lands granted to Walter fitz Alan by King David I in the mid-12th century, when Walter was also made first hereditary Steward of Scotland. The castle was constructed from wood with stone foundations, and may have been a motte.[1] The strategic location of this castle was designed to prevent the eastward expansion of Somerled's lordship in Argyll and the Isles.[2]\nRenfrew Castle\nIn the 13th century the Stewart family, descendants of Walter fitz Alan, constructed a new residence at the north end of the old High Street of Renfrew. This castle has been attributed to James, 5th High Steward (died 1309).[3]\nIt was captured by the English during the Wars of Scottish Independence, and King Edward I of England granted Renfrew to Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, in 1301. In 1310 King Edward II of England ordered that the castle and burgh be sacked after he spent one night at the castle. Renfrew was then given in a charter by Edward Balliol to David de Strathbogie, Earl of Atholl, in 1332. The Stewarts with the help of Sir Colin Campbell of Lochow later recaptured Renfrew Castle.[2]\nRobert, 7th High Steward, is traditionally said to have been born at Renfrew Castle. On his accession as King Robert II in 1371, the castle became a royal residence.[3] The castle was visited by monarchs including James IV, who stayed there when visiting Paisley Abbey.[2]\nIn the 18th century, the castle was dismantled and the stone used to build soap works. This was replaced by Castlehill House, which was itself demolished, and the ground now forms a playground surrounded by modern buildings. The name Castlehill Gardens and a low mound can still be seen, though excavations in 1997 discovered no evidence of the castle other than pottery sherds dated to the 12th-14th centuries.[3]\nInch Castle\nIn the later 15th century the King's Inch was granted to Sir John Ross, who built a new castle over the ruins of Walter's motte. Known as Inch Castle, this building was occupied by the Ross family until 1732, and in 1760 was sold to Andrew Spiers of Elderslie. Spiers demolished the castle and constructed Elderslie House in 1777, which was in turn demolished in 1924.[1] The rebuilt castle had four stories and was topped by crow-stepped gables. There was a central stair-tower, corbelled out above the first floor.[4]\nThe King's Inch is no longer an island, being on the south bank of the Clyde, and Braehead Power Station was built over the area in the 20th century. This too has since been demolished and the exact location of Inch Castle is now uncertain, though it lies somewhere in the Braehead development area. Investigations in 2005 identified the foundations of Elderslie House at grid reference NS 5140 6762, as well as features on the same site that could represent the 15th-century castle.[1]\nReferences\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "name": "Cavers Castle",
    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavers_Castle",
    "text": "Ruined tower house in Scottish Borders, Scotland, UK\nCavers Castle, also known as Cavers House, is a ruined tower house located at Cavers, Scottish Borders, Scotland.[1] Cavers Castle was a much extended tower house of the Douglas family dating back to the 15th or 16th century, and built upon the site of an earlier stronghold of the Balliols. It was repeatedly attacked during the 16th century wars with England, and substantially remodelled in the 17th century to form a mansion house, itself extended and remodelled in baronial style by Peddie and McKay in the 1890s. It was eventually deroofed and partially demolished in the 1950s, and was sold most recently in 2019. There are developing plans to restore the building, which is a listed building.[2]\nHistory\nThe lay lands and barony of Cavers first appear in the hands of the Balliol family in 1268, when Alexander de Balliol of Cavers is first mentioned in documents.[3] The church lands of Cavers, by comparison, were held by Jedburgh Abbey from early in the reign of King William the Lion.[4]\nDuring the Scottish Wars of Independence, Alexander Balliol of Cavers was captured – perhaps at Dunbar in 1296, and in return for his release fought for King Edward I of England from 1297,[5] although the English kept his son in the Tower of London as insurance for his good behaviour.[6] In 1311 the castle was occupied by an English garrison,[7] but there are no mentions of it after the fall of Jedburgh Castle to the Scots in 1314. The English presentation of a priest to Cavers church in 1319 suggests the area remained subject to English authority.[8] A safe conduct was issued at Cavers by James Douglas in 1321 to permit a group of English cavalry to enter Scotland, but the castle is not specifically mentioned.[9] In 1358 Cavers was held by the Earl of Mar,[10] the Balliols having been forfeited of their estates for their opposition to the regime of Robert the Bruce.[11] In 1368 the Earl of Douglas, elsewhere at this date styled lord of the barony of Cavers[12] was granted lands in the barony of Cavers in a document signed there,[13] indicating that the buildings of a baronial centre of sorts had been erected there by this date. In 1397, Cavers was in the hands of Isabel, Countess of Mar,[14] the niece of Earl Thomas, and in the early 15th century, she granted the lands and barony of Cavers to her nephew, Archibald Douglas,[15] the younger of the two illegitimate sons of James, Earl of Douglas.[16] This was disputed by King Robert III, who granted them to Sir David Fleming of Biggar,[17] as well as by George Douglas, Earl of Angus,[17] who had been granted the rights of Cavers held by Sir James Sandilands.[17] Archibald had his grant confirmed by King James I in 1412,[18] and became heritable Sheriff of Roxburgh/Teviotdale[19] – these two titles were used interchangeably.\nMid-13th-century piscina at the castle\nGiven the general context of baronial castle building in Scotland and the Borders at this time, and the wealth and status of the Balliols, one might expect a ditched manorial centre, which may have been built, and defended, partially in timber.[20] However, nothing remains today of the castle which can be conclusively identified as pre-dating the Douglas period of ownership. Although a mid-13th-century piscina[21] has been built into the tower, it was set in place with cement, dating this event firmly to the late 19th or early 20th century.\nAgain, given the general context, it is likely that Archibald (last mentioned in 1455) was the builder of the tower house which formed the core of the castle up until its demolition in the 1950s. On the basis of general style, the tower is dated to the 15th or early 16th century, and the “castrum” of Cavers is first mentioned in a charter of 1511.[21]\nWilliam Douglas of Cavers was \"well-beloved\" by James III, and he and his followers fought for James III at the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488, St Barnabas day. They were forgiven by his victorious son James IV.[22] A charter of 1509 mentions that William Douglas of Cavers had been killed resisting the English.[23] James IV made the castle and lands of Cavers a free barony in August 1511 for Sir James Douglas (d. 1545).[24] In 1523 Teviotdale was attacked by the English with its strongholds described as overthrown,[25] and again in 1542.[26]\nCavers was burnt in June 1542 by English raiders led by Jak of Musgay and Little John Heron, who burnt lands and stole goods on the Caill Water and in Teviotdale.[27] In March 1543 Regent Arran forgave Walter Scott of Branxholme who had been accused in 1535 of burning Cavers and Denholm with the English border warden Lord Dacre and Christopher Dacre.[28]\nDuring the war known as the Rough Wooing the tower of Cavers or its farm was burnt by Lord Hertford in September 1545.[29] In 1547, after the battle of battle of Pinkie, William Douglas of Cavers (the sixth laird) swore allegiance to King Edward VI along with the Kerr lairds of Ferniehirst and Cessford.[30] The English journalist of the war, William Patten, wrote that the Laird of Cavers gave his oath of assurance to the Duke of Somerset on 23 September 1547 at Roxburgh Castle, with many other lairds of Teviotdale and the marches.[31]\nThe lairds of Cavers are not prominent in records at this time, being overshadowed by the Kerr Wardens of the Middle March, whose authority was military and cross-border. The domestic authority of the sheriff was perhaps less important. The tower house remained a significant building, being depicted as a tall tower, barmkin wall and ancillary courtyard buildings on Pont's map of 1590 – 1600.[32] From the disbanding of the guard on the border by King James VI in 1621,[33] any remaining military function the castle may have had ceased, and from this date onwards it served primarily as the residence of the Douglas lairds. Inside the tower Inside the castle wing\nIn January 1570 Richard Norton and his son Francis, English exiles from Naworth after the Rising of the North found a refuge at Cavers.[34] In the 1580s, Robert Douglas of Cavers was Gentleman of Horse to Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus.[35] James VI and I made a return visit to Scotland in 1617. He rode from Dunglass Castle to Cavers on 14 May 1617.[36] While the king was at Cavers, he knighted William Fenwick of Northumberland.[37]\nSir William Douglas, ninth laird of Cavers, surrendered his hereditary office of Sheriff of Roxburghshire to the crown in 1626 for £20,000 Scots.[38] He was a supporter of the National Covenant,[39] and the Hawick Covenant, which he signed in 1638, was kept at Cavers.[40] Development of the castle after 1603 is as yet unclear, but it is clear that the estate, like many others suffered financially during the latter 17th and first half of the 18th century. The family also failed to flourish, with the 12th, 14th, 15th, and 16th lairds all being succeeded by brothers, and the 17th laird by a cousin.[41] The last of the direct male Douglas line died in 1878.[42] The military map drawn up by General William Roy of c1750 shows that the house was the centre of a large estate, but was not surrounded by much in the way of formal gardens.[43] The earliest photographs of Cavers House show that it had been much extended by the late 19th century, when the Palmer Douglas family had become lairds,[42] and domesticized to have the appearance of a large house, the old tower being completely subsumed. At this time the house was often leased out to guests along with shooting rights,[44] the family themselves preferring to reside at Midgard House from 1863.[44] Amongst people known to have worked at the house during the 19th century was the botanist John Scott, who served his horticultural apprenticeship at Cavers.[45]\nIn the 1890s, the house was remodelled in grand baronial style,[21] which was undoubtedly a further burden to a struggling estate, but the impact of both World Wars was substantial, and according to family records Archibald Palmer Douglas returned to Cavers House from Midgard in the 1940s, which was provided with electricity in 1946 for the first time.[44] He died the following year, and his son James factored the estate on behalf of his grandmother until 1949.[44] Death duties resulted in the estate being broken up, and although James attempted to sell the house, he could not find a buyer, and after being deroofed, the house was used for explosives practice in 1954[21] before being sold off along with the rest of the broken-up estate. The old tower survives as a shell along with part of the attached mansion.\nReferences\nExternal links\nCavers Castle on The Castle Guy\nDouglas of Cavers pennant, National Museums of Scotland\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "name": "Hermitage Castle",
    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitage_Castle",
    "text": "Semi-ruined castle in Scotland\nHermitage Castle is a semi-ruined castle in the border region of Scotland. It stands in the remote valley of the Hermitage Water, part of Liddesdale in Roxburghshire. It is under the care of Historic Scotland. The castle has a reputation, both from its history and its appearance, as one of the most sinister and atmospheric castles in Scotland.\nHistory\nOrigins of the name\nIt is thought that the name derives from Old French: l'armitage – guardhouse. The castle was known as the guardhouse of the bloodiest valley in Britain, and the \"Strength of Liddesdale\".\nHermitage Castle was supposedly built by one Nicholas de Soulis around 1240, in a typical Norman Motte and Bailey pattern. It stayed in his family until approximately 1320 when his descendant, William de Soulis, forfeited it because of suspected witchcraft and the attempted regicide of King Robert I of Scotland. Legend has it that Soulis's tenantry, having suffered unbearable depredations, arrested him, and at the nearby Ninestane Rig (a megalithic circle), had him encased in lead sheet and boiled to death. In actuality, he died, a prisoner, in Dumbarton Castle.\nUnder the Douglases\nIn 1338, the then incumbent, Englishman Sir Ralph de Neville was besieged by Sir William Douglas, The Knight of Liddesdale, known as the \"Flower of Chivalry\" (this sobriquet had to do with his abilities as a knight, although it is often misinterpreted by people with a rather romantic view of history). It was here that Douglas imprisoned and starved to death Sir Alexander Ramsay of Dalhousie.[1] his competitor for royal favour.[2]\nAfter the Battle of Neville's Cross and Liddesdale's capture by the English, the castle fell into the hands of the English for a time and was given to the care of William Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre. Upon Liddesdale's death, brought about by a near kinsman, William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, the castle was given to the then baron but later 1st Earl of Douglas. He enabled the construction of most of the present building, possibly with the help of John Lewin, master mason at Durham Cathedral. The castle remained in the hands of the Black Douglases until 1455. The Black Douglas line had so incensed the King that James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas was forfeited, never to return to Scotland, and the beneficences that they had enjoyed passed to the Red Douglas line, including Hermitage Castle.\nUnder the Hepburns\nKing James IV was suspicious of the then Earl of Angus, Archibald, Bell the Cat and his relationship with Henry VII of England, and ordered him to relinquish The Hermitage to the Crown. On 6 March 1492 Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell had a charter of the lands and lordship of Liddesdale, including The Hermitage Castle, etc., upon the resignation of the same by Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus, the latter getting the lordship of Bothwell (but not the Earldom) which Patrick in turn had resigned for the exchange. The Hepburns of Bothwell, then rising in favour with the king, became keepers and lords of The Hermitage.\nIn time, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, held the castle. Mary, Queen of Scots, made a famous marathon journey on horseback from Jedburgh to visit the wounded Bothwell there, only a few weeks after the birth of her son. Bothwell had been injured by John Elliot of Park. He had captured Elliot with other border reivers, and brought him to the Hermitage. Elliot tried to escape and Bothwell shot him with his pistol. The wounded man managed to injure Bothwell with a two-handed sword.[3]\nMary and Bothwell were to marry shortly after the murder of her 2nd husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, regardless of the fact that Bothwell was implicated amongst the conspirators. After Mary's forced abdication following the confrontation at Carberry Hill, Bothwell, facing charges of treason, fled to Norway and his titles and estates were forfeited by Act of Parliament. Whilst attempting to raise an army to restore Mary to the throne, he was arrested by King Frederik's men for breach of marriage contract with Anna Throndsen, and imprisoned at Dragsholm Castle in Denmark, where he died insane and in appalling conditions. His mummified body could at one time be seen at nearby Fårevejle Church.\nThomas Kerr of Ferniehirst was made keeper of Liddesdale and Hermitage Castle in 1584.[4] Bothwell's nephew, Francis Stewart, 1st Earl of Bothwell received a new creation as Earl of Bothwell, and was made Keeper of the castle. As a grandson of James V, albeit through an illegitimate line, he was viewed by some as a potential replacement for James VI. In 1591, Bothwell was arrested, tried, gaoled and forfeited for his supposed involvement with the infamous North Berwick Witches. He obtained a pardon in 1593 but again became involved in intrigue and he was again attainted, by Act of Parliament, on 21 July 1593. The Hermitage once again reverted to the Crown.\nUnder the Scotts\nThe following year, James granted the castle to Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch (\"the bold Buccleuch\"), a notorious Border reiver, Warden of the western marches, Keeper of Liddesdale, and leader of the daring and infamous attack on Carlisle Castle to rescue Willie Armstrong of Kinmont.\nDecline\nHermitage Castle in 1814.\nThe castle became obsolete after the Union of the Crowns, in 1603 and fell into disrepair; by the turn of the eighteenth century it was a ruin. Hermitage gave its name to the Viscountcy of Hermitage, conferred in 1706 on Henry, third son of the first Duke of Buccleuch as a subsidiary title of the Earldom of Deloraine. This title became extinct in 1807. Some repairs to the castle were carried out in 1820 by the fifth Duke of Buccleuch. The Scotts are descended matrilinearly from the Douglases of Drumlanrig, a cadet branch, and sometimes use the surname Montagu-Douglas-Scott, thus maintaining a continuity with earlier times.\nToday\nThe castle remained a property of the Scotts until 1930, when it was handed over to the care of the Nation. It is now cared for by Historic Environment Scotland, an executive agency of the Scottish Government, and is open to visitors from 1 April to 31 October each year. It is closed during the winter season. The castle, together with a series of ancillary features, is protected as a scheduled monument.[5]\nGhostlore\nHermitage Castle is the subject of local ghostlore stories where it is reputed to be haunted by both Redcap Sly, de Soulis's familiar spirit,[6][7] and by Mary, Queen of Scots.[8]\nGallery An old photograph of the Castle, possibly dating from c1860 Inside Hermitage Castle Hermitage Castle seen from the ruined chapel Rear of castle\nSee also\nHermitage, Scottish Borders\nHermitage Water\nList of places in the Scottish Borders\nList of places in Scotland\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Hermitage Castle.\nHistoric Environment Scotland: Visitor guide\nHermitage Castle Near Newcastleton\nHermitage Castle & Mary, Queen of Scots\nThe Border Reivers\nGhostly Hermitage\nHepburn -fanciers website.

    "name": "Hume Castle",

    "text": "Scottish castle (ruin)\nHume Castle is the heavily modified remnants of a late 12th- or early 13th-century castle of enceinte held by the powerful Hume or Home family, Wardens of the Eastern March who became successively the Lords Home and the Earls of Home. The village of Hume is located between Greenlaw and Kelso, two miles north of the village of Stichill, in Berwickshire, Scotland. (OS ref.- NT704413). It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, recorded as such by Historic Environment Scotland.[1]\nStanding as it does, on an impressive height above its eponymous castleton, it commands fine prospects across the Merse, with views to the English border at Carter Bar. It had historically been used as a beacon to warn of invasion.\nIts enormous walls were created in the 18th century but remnants of the central keep and other features can still be seen.\nHistory\nOrigins\nWilliam de Home, son of Sir Patrick de Greenlaw (a younger son of Cospatric I, Earl of Dunbar), acquired the lands of Home in the early 13th century through marriage to his cousin Ada (the daughter of Patrick I, Earl of Dunbar). He then took his surname from his estate, a not uncommon practice of the time. It is assumed that he built the first stone fortifications at the site.\nJames II stayed at Home en route to the siege of Roxburgh Castle, the last English garrison left in Scotland following the Wars of Independence. (James was killed by the explosion of an early bombard during the siege.)\nPlaque at the foot of Hume Castle hill\nSixteenth century and the Rough Wooing\nIn August 1515 Regent Albany imprisoned members of the Hume family at Dunfermline, with Adam Tinmo, the Constable of Hume Castle. At this time, Scotland's Governor Regent Albany was planning to bring an army against the Hume family on the Scottish borders. Albany captured Hume Castle, but according to a report by Cardinal Wolsey's chaplain, William Frankelayn, Chancellor of Durham, Lord Hume, Lord Chamberlain, retook the castle on 26 August 1515, and kept Albany's captain, Lord Fleming's uncle, prisoner. Lord Hume then slighted his own castle, razed the walls, \"and dammed the well for ever more.\"[2]\nBefore the advent of artillery, Hume castle was considered almost impregnable. However it was captured in 1547 during the \"Rough Wooing\", by the Lord Protector Somerset. The Scottish ruler, Regent Arran, had sent 12 gunners to defend the castle in August 1547.[3] George Home, 4th Lord Home, was injured at the Battle of Pinkie and his son Alexander captured. After stout resistance by Mariotta (or Marion) Haliburton, Lady Home, the castle fell and an English garrison was installed. According to an English account, the castle was rendered by the negotiation of Lady Home after the English army encamped nearby at the Hirsel or Hare Craig. Although English artillery was placed to commence bombardment, no shot was fired by either side. Somerset Herald conveyed Lady Home's instructions to the reluctant garrison who would have preferred Lord Home's word as a warrant for their surrender.[4]\nBaron Dudley holds the castle for England\nSir Edward Sutton, a cousin of the Earl of Warwick, was made Captain of Hume, and received the keys from Andrew Home, Commendator of Jedburgh and Restennet, on Thursday 22 September 1547. There were seventy-eight Scots within, and Edward Sutton found guns including; 2 batard culverins; a saker; 3 brass falconets; and eight other iron guns.[4] More guns were brought to hold the castle, and an English inventory of December 1547 lists 21 cannons including 4 fowlers, and 40 hand-guns.[5] Minor strengthening work was carried out by the English, on the advice of the military engineer William Ridgeway, but only £734 was spent, the local stone was unsuitable and limestone at Roxburgh too far away.[6]\nMariotta, Lady Home, complained to the Duke of Somerset on 2 November 1547 that she had, \"been very sore examined for the rendering of Hume\", and accused of taking money. She thought it marvellous that anyone could think she could keep the \"sober barmkin\" of Hume against the English army, when all the nobles of Scotland could not keep the field.[7] Hume Castle was nearly lost in February 1548, when Captain Pelham travelled to Warkworth Castle to collect pay for the Spanish mercenary garrison. The soldiers planned to rob him and change sides. Loyal members of the garrison fired the beacon and Sir John Ellerker's men arrested the would-be deserters. One was killed escaping, and Grey of Wilton planned to hang six of them, but the two leaders escaped into Scotland.[8]\nLord Home recaptures the castle\nAfter the death of his father, captive in the Tower of London, the young Alexander, 5th Lord Home, with the help of his brother Andrew the Commendator, recaptured the castle in December 1548. The first man in was Tulloch, a servant of the laird of Buccleuch.[9] Edward Sutton was blamed for losing the castle by negligence to a night assault. Jean de Beaugué, a French soldier gave an account of the re-capture. He said that an inside-man let in seven Scots, and at night an eighth man climbed in. These then overwhelmed the garrison. In Jean's account the man who climbed the wall was a Home, aged 60.[10] Sutton was taken to Spynie Palace,[11] and was still a prisoner at the end of the war, when the Earl of Shrewsbury was asked to organise his release by the exchange of French hostages.[12]\nMariotta, Lady Home, sent the news to Mary of Guise on 28 December 1548 from Edinburgh. Regent Arran thanked John Hume of Cowdenknowes for his service recovering the castle. The English unsuccessfully attempted to recapture Hume in February 1549.[13] Lady Home was once again installed in the castle in March 1549 and complained to Mary of Guise in March 1549 of the behaviour of the French and Spanish garrison obtaining credit from the villagers.[14] When the English abandoned their fort at Lauder the guns there were dragged by oxen to Hume Castle.[15]\nMary of Guise ordered the people of Sherriffdom of Berwick and Lauderdale to provide 320 oxen to remove the guns from Hume in February 1558. The cannons were taken to the fort at Eyemouth.[16] The castle was again besieged in April 1570, during the Marian Civil War, by the Earl of Sussex during his raid into Scotland. The defenders capitulated within twelve hours, in awe of his superior numbers and the firepower of \"three battery pieces and two sakers\" brought from Wark Castle.[17] Regent Morton gave money to Agnes Gray, Lady Home, in the 1570s to keep the castle garrisoned for James VI.[18]\nDownfall\nThe 17th century saw the demise of Hume Castle as a habitable fortress. The Earls of Home had already established another seat at Dunglass Castle and, by 1611, at The Hirsel. Hume Castle finally succumbed to the forces of Cromwell in 1650 during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. James, 3rd Earl of Home was a prominent member of the Kirk Party. After Cromwell's successful investiture of Edinburgh Castle, he sent Colonel George Fenwick with two regiments to besiege the Earl's Castle. Catherine Morrison, Lady Wedderburn, paid £6 to bring cannon to defend Hume.[19] The governor of the castle, Colonel John Cockburn,[20] engaged in witty repartee with the Roundheads, but refused to deliver the castle. He claimed that he had no idea who Cromwell was and that the castle stood on a rock. He sent a note to Fenwick with the following doggerel: \"I, Will of the Wastle\nAm King of my castle\nAll the dogs in the town\nShall gare gang me down!\"[21]\nHowever once the bombardment began, it became clear that there was no option but submission. Fenwick's troops entered the castle, and accepted Cockburn's surrender. Cockburn and his men were given quarter for life only. They retreated and Fenwick slighted the fortification.[22]\nResurrection\nCrenellation at Hume\nIn the early 18th century, Hume and its environs came into the possession of the Earls of Marchmont, wealthier and more influential cadets of the main line of the family.[citation needed] The Castle at this point was level with the ground that it was built upon. At some point before his death in 1794, Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, 3rd Lord Polwarth, restored the castle as a folly, from the waste left from its destruction, on the original foundations of its curtain wall. He adorned the wall tops with enormous crenellations that are more picturesque than practical.\nThe Great Alarm\nIn light of its function as a mediæval early warning system, the castle was used again as a beacon during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1804, on the night of 31 January, a sergeant of the Berwickshire Volunteers in charge of the beacon mistook charcoal burners' fires on nearby Dirrington Great Law for a warning. Lighting the beacon at Hume Castle, he set in train the lighting of all the Borders beacons to the West, and 3,000 volunteers turned out in what became known as 'The Great Alarm'.[21]\nAgain, during the Second World War it functioned as a lookout post, and was also to act as a base for resistance in the event of a German invasion.[citation needed]\nToday\nThe castle is still seen as the spiritual home of the many Homes and Humes in Scotland and abroad. The castle was bought by the state in 1929, and in 1985 a restoration programme was undertaken by the Berwickshire Civic Society funded by the Scottish Office. It re-opened to the public in 1992. In 2006 the Civic Society handed over the castle to a charitable trust run by the Clan Home Association, under the auspices of Historic Scotland, to maintain its preservation in the future.[23]\nSee also\nList of places in the Scottish Borders\nClan Home\nHume (surname)\nReferences\nSources\nOrdnance Gazetteer-Scotland Vol IV,ed.

    "text": "Castle in Scottish Borders, Scotland, UK\nNeidpath Castle is an L-plan rubble-built tower house, overlooking the River Tweed about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of Peebles in the Borders of Scotland. The castle is both a wedding venue and filming location and can be viewed by appointment.\nHistory\nAn early castle was probably built here by Simon Fraser of Oliver Castle between 1263 and 1266, while he held the office of High Sheriff of Tweeddale.[1] The barony of Neidpath was acquired by the Hay family, through marriage in the early 14th century to the heiress Margaret, a daughter of the sheriff's son, Simon Fraser of Oliver and Neidpath.[2] Sir William de Haya (d.c.1390) probably built the present castle in the late 14th century. It was held by them until the 17th century, although Sir William's son, Sir Thomas Hay, married the daughter and heiress of Sir Hugh Gifford of Yester, acquiring Yester Castle, which became the principal family seat, although Neidpath continued to be used.[3] It was visited by Mary, Queen of Scots in 1563,[4] and by her son James VI in 1587.[1]\nIn 1645, Neidpath was garrisoned against the Royalist forces of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose,[2] although the following year, John Hay of Yester joined the King's party, and was created 1st Earl of Tweeddale by King Charles II.[3] During Oliver Cromwell's invasion of Scotland in 1650, Neidpath was attacked. Mike Salter states that the castle was surrendered without a fight,[2] although other sources suggest that it required the longest assault on any stronghold south of the River Forth to force it to surrender.[1] James Taylor, writing in 1887, states that the 13th-century tower was demolished by artillery during the siege[3] and the Listed building report notes that there was damage to the west wing.[5] During the 1660s, the 2nd Earl of Tweeddale remodelled the castle, and constructed outbuildings.[2] The 2nd Earl was an agricultural \"improver\", who planted an avenue of yews, of which one side remains. However, he was declared bankrupt, and sold Neidpath to William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry in 1686.[2]\nIn 1693, Queensberry gave the castle to his second son William Douglas, later the 1st Earl of March. His son William, the 2nd Earl, made alterations to the castle in the 18th century. The 3rd Earl inherited the title and estates of the Duke of Queensberry in 1778, and subsequently let Neidpath to tenants.[2] These included the philosopher and historian Adam Ferguson.[1] The castle suffered neglect, however, and by 1790 the upper storeys of the wing had collapsed.[2] William Wordsworth and Walter Scott both visited the castle in 1803; Wordsworth was appalled at the felling of \"a brotherhood of venerable Trees\" writing a sonnet beginning \"Degenerate Douglas! oh, the unworthy Lord.\"[1][6] On the death of the Duke in 1810, the castle, along with the earldom of March, was inherited by the Earl of Wemyss, although the dukedom went to the Scotts of Buccleuch.[2] Neidpath still belongs to Earl of Wemyss; the Earl's heir takes his courtesy title, Lord Neidpath, from it.\nDescription\nEntrance to Neidpath Castle\nNeidpath Castle is a tall L-plan tower house, one leg of the L being very short. It has rounded corners. The battlements are roofed and the sentry walk is a balustraded balcony. There are few windows, and two still have their iron bar protection. Inside, the basement and the first-floor hall are vaulted, and the hall is further divided by a wooden floor into two storeys. Other features include a pit dungeon, and some small exhibitions of artifacts found in the locale. There are remains of a partly walled garden. The archway is decorated with both the goats head emblem of the Hays and the strawberries of the Frasers.[5][7]\nGardens\nA series of five terraces, set at 8m centres, lies to the south-east and east of the castle. Originally serving as ornate garden terraces these were apparently enclosed by a wall which was recorded in 1581 and listed as a \"sloping parterre\" in 1815. Between 1682 and 1686 the terraces were remodelled and a summe house was built.[8]\nTraditions\nThe castle is said to be haunted by the ghost of Jean Douglas, referred to by Walter Scott in his poem as \"the Maid of Neidpath\", the youngest daughter of William Douglas, Earl of March. Forbidden to marry the son of the laird of Tushielaw, who was considered below her station, she dwined while her lover was sent away. When he returned she was so wasted that he did not recognise her, causing her to die of a broken heart.[9] She is reputed to appear clad in a full-length brown dress with a large white collar.[10][9]\nRecent history\nNeidpath has been used as a location for many films and television series, including Merlin: The Quest Begins starring Jason Connery and directed by David Winning, which was filmed in September and October 1997. It also was used for the series of Sam and Colby in 2019.[11]\nSee also\nCastles in Scotland\nNeidpath, Saskatchewan, a hamlet in western Canada named after Neidpath Castle\nReferences\nFurther reading\nCoventry, Martin.

The eighteenth century tower is on the left hand side\nNisbet House is a 17th-century mansion in the Scottish Borders. It is located on the north side of the Blackadder Water, 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) south of Duns, in the Merse, a low-lying part of the former county of Berwickshire. It was built in about 1630 by Sir Alexander Nisbet, ancestor of the heraldic authority Alexander Nisbet (1657–1725). Architectural evidence suggests that the building incorporates, at its eastern end, a square pele tower that was the former house. The house is protected as a category A listed building.[1]\nHistory\nThe Nisbet family built two fortified houses or pele towers in the 12th century, East Nisbet and West Nisbet. East Nisbet, now known as Allanbank, was located on the Blackadder Water near Allanton, although the original tower no longer exists. Wester Nisbet remains, and was extended in the 1630s to form the bulk of the present house. The laird at the time was Sir Alexander Nisbet of that Ilk (c. 1580–1660). Sir Alexander Nisbet overextended his finances in supporting Charles I in the Civil War, and was forced to sell the property to John Ker in 1652. John's son by his second wife, George Carre, Lord Nisbet, was born here around 1700.\nA square tower, with fine interior plasterwork, in the classical style of William Adam was added to the west end in 1774. The house remained with Ker descendants (latterly in the person of Lord Sinclair) until the 1950s, when the estate was sold to Lord Brocket. After partial modernisation, the house was sold again in the mid-1960s to a local farmer, and remained unoccupied until its recent and comprehensive restoration as a private residence.\nNisbet estate\nThe former estate contains a very small mill, an 18th-century U-plan stable range (now converted into homes), and a scattering of cottages and farmhouses. Dunse Spa, a source of mineral water in the 18th century, is just to the north of the Nisbet estate and the spa house still stands.\nGallery\nPhotographs of Nisbet House taken by Robert Chancellor Nesbit in the 1930s.

    "text": "Ruined castle near Roxburgh, Scotland\nFor vessels of this name, see Roxburgh Castle (ship).\nNot to be confused with Roxborough Castle.\nRuins of Roxburgh Castle, with Floors Castle in the background\nRoxburgh Castle, 1920, by E. W. Haslehust\nRoxburgh Castle is a ruined royal castle that overlooks the junction of the rivers Tweed and Teviot, in the Borders region of Scotland. The town and castle developed into the royal burgh of Roxburgh, which the Scots destroyed along with the castle after capturing it in 1460. Today the ruins stand in the grounds of Floors Castle, the seat of the Duke of Roxburghe, across the river from Kelso.\nHistory\nTradition states that King David I founded the castle; it is first recorded in c.1128 during his reign. In 1174, it was surrendered to England after the capture of William I at Alnwick, and was often in English hands thereafter. The Scots made many attempts to regain the fortress.[1] King Edward I of England imprisoned Mary Bruce in a cage hung outside the castle from 1306 to 1310. On 19 February 1314, it was retaken by Sir James Douglas (the \"Black Douglas\"), in a night attack. His men clothed in black cloaks were apparently mistaken for cattle. They then used rope and board ladders to climb the walls.[2] King Robert the Bruce ordered the castle demolished by his brother Edward Bruce, Earl of Carrick, and in the words of the Lanercost Chronicle \"all that beautiful castle the Scots pulled down to the ground, like the other castles that they had succeeded in capturing, lest the English should ever again rule the land by holding the castles.\"[3][4]\nThe castle was captured by the forces of Edward III of England in 1334.[5] Alexander Ramsay and his men recaptured Roxburgh Castle for the Scots on 30 March 1342 by means of a daring night escalade. It was retaken by the English shortly after the Battle of Neville's Cross in October 1346. A Scottish siege in 1417 necessitated repairs.\nIn August 1436, King James I of Scotland planned to conduct a siege of the castle. The king had gathered a huge army, sporting “...fine, large guns, both cannons and mortars”, manned by German gun crews under the command of Johannes Paule “Master of the King’s engines”. There was also a substantial contingent of Highlanders and Islesmen and archers brought by Alexander of Islay, Earl of Ross (who brought 3,000 men to the siege), as well as men-at-arms from the Lowlands, including the forces of Archibald, Earl of Douglas and his distant kin and rival, William, Earl of Angus (head of the Red Douglases of Tantallon). However, the Queen arrived to warn her husband that, certain princes of the realm were conspiring against him and a plot was afoot to kill him. Given that and the king's awareness that the Archbishop of York, the Bishop of Durham and the Earls of Northumberland had arrived with a force of northerners, he left the battlefield and his army dispersed, leaving behind his expensive German equipment.\nThe Scots again besieged Roxburgh in 1460; in the course of the action metal fragments from the explosion of one of his bombards killed King James II of Scotland. However, the Scots stormed Roxburgh, capturing it, and James' queen, Mary of Guelders, had the castle demolished.[1][6]\nIn 1545, during the war of the Rough Wooing, more accurately known as the Nine Years' War, the English garrison commanded by Ralph Bulmer built a rectangular fort on the site at the instigation of the Earl of Hertford.[7] In 1547, Hertford ordered the surveyor William Ridgeway and the Master Carpenter John Revell to build to a brewhouse, using a frame made for Wark Castle. Bulmer complained that Ridgeway's visits were infrequent and works incomplete.[8] He wanted to build a blacksmith's forge and a bulwark to the south to give access to drinking water.[9] This fort was destroyed in 1550 by the terms of the Treaty of Boulogne.[10]\nThe ruins of Roxburgh Castle stand in the grounds of Floors Castle, the seat of the Duke of Roxburghe.[11] These consist of a large mound, with some small fragments of stone walls, especially on the south side.\nThe 1314 capture of the castle is one of the inspirations of \"The Three Perils of Man\" by James Hogg.\nSee also\nList of places in the Scottish Borders\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Roxburgh Castle.\nCANMORE/RCAHMS record of Roxburgh Castle; Old Roxburgh Castle; Protector Somerset's Camp\nSCRAN image: Roxburgh Castle\n55°35′47″N 2°27′24″W / 55.59639°N 2.45667°W / 55.59639; -2.45667\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Scottish Borders\nThirlestane Castle.\nThirlestane Castle c.1690 by Cpt John Slezer\nThirlestane Castle is a castle set in extensive parklands near Lauder in the Borders of Scotland. The site is aptly named Castle Hill, as it stands upon raised ground. However, the raised land is within Lauderdale, the valley of the Leader Water. The land has been in the ownership of the Maitland family since 1587, and Thirlestane served as the seat of the Earls of Lauderdale. The castle was substantially extended in the 1670s by the first and only Duke of Lauderdale. Further additions were made in the 19th century. The castle is now cared for by a charitable trust, and is open to the public.\nHistory of the castle\nBefore the 13th century, a large fort or castle was built on Castle Hill near the Leader Water. It was the site of the ancient church of Lauder, where in 1482, James III's favourites, including the architect Robert Cochrane, were dragged by envious nobles led by Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus and hanged from the (earlier) Lauder Bridge. The sites of the ancient kirk and the bridge from which Cochrane and his colleagues met their demise, are now within the immediate policies of Thirlestane Castle, the church some 60 yards from the west front, and the bridge some quarter-mile to the north-east.[1]\nThis castle passed to Robert Lauder of that Ilk, who gave it in dowry to his daughter Alison and her husband George Wedderhede in 1532.[2] This couple, and their son, were all murdered in feuds, Alison in 1547. Presumably the lands reverted to her parents, her mother being Alison Cranstoun. They both died in the second half of 1567 leaving only young grandchildren as heirs.\nDuring the war with England known as the 'Rough Wooings' the site of the present castle was occupied by a large English artillery fort and garrison.[3] Following the design by Thomas Pettit, Surveyor of Calais, the fort was begun on 5 April 1548 by Sir Robert Bowes and was estimated to cost £296 and take four weeks to complete.[4] Hugh Willoughby was its captain.[5] The villagers of Lauderdale and further afield were summoned to demolish the fort and help transport the remaining artillery to Hume Castle in June 1550.[6]\nThe Cranstouns sold Castle Hill on 27 January 1587 to Sir John Maitland (d. 1595).[7] By the 22 March 1587, Maitland was \"busily occupied with his masons at the building of his house in the Fort of Lauder.\"[8]\nThe Maitland family\nMaitland's original peel tower (Old Thirlestane Castle\nThe Maitlands came to Britain from Normandy with William the Conqueror in 1066, originally settling in Northumberland. They gained power and influence as a result of military service but largely due to their contributions to law and the arts in the 16th century. William Maitland of Lethington, was Secretary to Mary, Queen of Scots, his younger brother was Sir John Maitland, Secretary of Scotland, who acquired Thirlestane in 1587. In the same year he built a large square keep or tower house upon the foundations and walls of the original fort. In 1590, Sir John was appointed Lord Chancellor of Scotland, and was ennobled as Lord Maitland of Thirlestane. This new house near Lauder was to replace the Maitland's original but now decaying (Old) Thirlestane Castle, a peel tower situated a mile or so to the south-east, the ruins of which are still extant near the hamlet of Thirlestane.\nJames VI of Scotland visited several times. He came in February 1591 to celebrate the wedding of John Maitland's niece to the Laird of Lugton.[9] He stayed again in October 1593.[10] After John Maitland's death on 3 October 1595, his widow Jean Fleming married the Earl of Cassilis and on 22 February 1599 Fleming and Cassilis hosted James VI at the castle.[11]\nLord Maitland's son John Maitland was created the 1st Earl of Lauderdale in 1624. His son was John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale (1616–1682), one of the most important Scottish figures of the late 17th century, being appointed Secretary of State for Scotland in 1660, a position carrying unrivalled power and influence. He employed the architect Sir William Bruce to transform the castle into a residence suitable for conducting the affairs of state. Between 1670 and 1676 the substantial alterations included the addition of the two front towers and the grand staircase, in addition to extensive internal modifications creating lavish staterooms with magnificent plasterwork ceilings. Lauderdale had Bruce retain much of the castle's earlier fabric giving it an external aura of antiquity, while the interiors met the highest fashion in seventeenth century planning and furnishing. This allowed Lauderdale to revere the antiquity of his family residence at the same time as living in high contemporary fashion.[12] After the Duke of Lauderdale's death, his widow Elizabeth Maitland, Duchess of Lauderdale, explained a letter how much he had preferred Thirlestane to Lethington Castle, and thought it better to settle his family there rather than in Lothian. He had even thought of being buried in Lauder Kirk.[13]\nBy the 19th century, in more peaceful times, the castle took on the role of a Scottish country mansion for the Earls of Lauderdale. In 1840 the Edinburgh architects David Bryce and William Burn were engaged to design extensions to the castle. Their additions consist of two large wings flanking the central keep and a south wing, constructed around a central courtyard, housing new kitchens, pantries, laundries and servants' quarters.\nDuring World War Two the castle was home to St. Hilary's, a girls' school evacuated from Edinburgh. The 15th Earl and Countess of Lauderdale lived in the north wing of the castle, while the school used the rest. The dorms were on the upper floors, while the main rooms were classrooms. The great dining room was used as the school dining room and assembly hall. St. Hilary's remained at Thirlestane until the end of 1944 when they returned to Edinburgh.[14]\nThe castle today\nThirlestane Castle gardens.\nCaptain Gerald Maitland-Carew inherited the castle in 1972 from his maternal grandmother, Ethel, Countess of Lauderdale, wife of the 15th Earl. At this time, the castle was in a serious state of disrepair, requiring extensive renovation. In 1984 the castle was given to a charitable trust established to ensure its preservation, and major repairs were carried out, assisted by financial grants awarded by the Historic Buildings Council and the National Heritage Memorial Fund.\nIn addition to the grounds, the castle itself and its interiors, Thirlestane is noted for fine collections of paintings, furniture, porcelain and an historic toy collection. In 2016 the castle is open to visitors from 3 May until 2 October (Tuesday to Thursday and Sundays).\nIn June 2021, planning permission was granted to Lauderdale Estates to construct holiday lodges in the Castle grounds.[15]\nReferences\nExternal links\nThirlestane Castle website\nThirlestane Castle, Gazetteer for Scotland\nGroundplan of English fort, plate 66 in Hale, John Rigby, Renaissance War Studies, Hambledon (1983)\nClan Maitland Society web site\nSee also\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Thirlestane Castle.\nList of places in the Scottish Borders\n55°43′21″N 2°44′37″W / 55.72250°N 2.74361°W / 55.72250; -2.74361\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Converted tower house in Traquair, Scottish Borders\nLocation map of Traquair House\nTraquair House\nTraquair House, approximately 7 miles southeast of Peebles, is claimed to be the oldest continually inhabited house in Scotland. Whilst not strictly a castle, it is built in the style of a fortified mansion. It pre-dates the Scottish Baronial style of architecture, and may have been one of the influences on this style. The estate contains the famous Traquair Brewery.\nHistory\nTraquair House in 1814\nThe house is built on the site of a hunting seat used by the Scottish kings from the 12th century, though no part of the present building can be dated with certainty before the 15th century. Alexander I was the first Scottish king to stay and hunt at Traquair. At that time it was a remote \"castle\", surrounded by forest. Upon Alexander III's death in 1286, the peace of the Borders region was shattered and Traquair became a key link in the chain of defence that guarded the Tweed Valley against English invasion.\nOver the next two centuries Traquair's ownership changed often, at times coming under the control of the English, and at others, the Scottish throne. In the 1460s James III conferred the estate on Dr William Rogers, an eminent musician, and one of his favourites. After holding the lands for upwards of nine years, Dr Rogers sold them for an insignificant sum in 1478 to the Earl of Buchan. The Earl gifted the estate to his illegitimate son, James Stuart (1480-1513), 1st Laird of Traquair, in 1491. James Stuart obtained letters of legitimation and married the heiress of the Rutherfords, with whom he received the estates of Rutherford and Wells in Roxburghshire. He was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. His daughter, Jane Stewart, had a daughter Janet with the Earl of Angus born out of wedlock, who married Patrick Ruthven, 3rd Lord Ruthven. Traquair remained the family seat of the Earls of Traquair for the next four centuries.\nMary, Queen of Scots, visited Traquair in August 1566.[1] James VI came to Traquair on 9 March 1602.[2]\nIn 1875, Traquair passed to a cousin of the Stuarts, Henry Constable Maxwell. He was a direct descendant, but via the female line. The National Portrait Gallery holds a 1992 portrait of Catherine Maxwell Stuart, 21st Lady of Traquair.[3]\nFeatures\nTraquair is a 50-room house. The rooms include \"The Drawing Room\", containing ancestral portraits and photographs of the current residents; \"The Dressing Room\", which is decorated to demonstrate life in former times; \"The Museum Room\", containing a mural dating from 1530, one of the oldest to survive in a secular building in Scotland, as well as charters stamped with the royal seals and signatures of the Scottish Kings; \"The King's Room\", where Mary, Queen of Scots stayed in 1566 and which contains some relics belonging to her and the Jacobites, such as her rosary, crucifix, purse, a silk quilt, and letters bearing her signature; \"The Still Room\", where breakfast is taken among the 18th-century porcelain that decorates the shelves; and \"The Dining Room\", one of the last additions to the house, built in the late 17th century. There is a Roman Catholic chapel built in 1829, following the Catholic emancipation. The 18th-century library contains more than 3,000 volumes. Although three lairds made alterations to the house prior to the 17th century, Traquair has changed little, architecturally, since then.\nThe Bear Gates at the main entrance to the grounds were installed by the fifth Earl, Charles Stuart, in 1738. When they were closed, after Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) passed through in 1745, the Earl vowed they would never be opened again until a Stuart king returned.[4][5]\nTam-Lin (film)\nThe 1970 horror film Tam-Lin was filmed at Traquair. It starred Ava Gardner; other cast members included Joanna Lumley, Stephanie Beecham and Ian McShane.[6][7]\nBrewery\nThe Traquair House Brewery was revived in 1965 by Peter Maxwell Stuart, the 20th laird of Traquair, using the 18th-century domestic brewery equipment that had previously been used to make beer for the house.[8] Ale is fermented in the original oak tuns, some of which are over 200 years old.[9] The brewery makes a range of beers, though the two main brands are Jacobite Ale and House Ale.[10] Traquair House Ale\nAle was brewed at Traquair during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. In 1739 a 200-gallon copper was installed in the brew house under the chapel.[11]\nThe Maze\nTraquair House MazeThe maze was designed by John Schofield and originally planted with Leyland cypress until the severe winter in 1983 when over two thirds of the trees died. It was replanted with hardier beech trees.[12]\nSee also\nEarl of Traquair\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Traquair House.\nTraquair House\nTam Lin (1970) - IMDb\n55°36′30″N 03°03′50″W / 55.60833°N 3.06389°W / 55.60833; -3.06389\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Ruined fortification in South Ayrshire, Scotland\nCraigie Castle, in the old Barony of Craigie, is a ruined fortification situated about 4 miles (6.4 km) southeast of Kilmarnock and 1 mile (1.6 km) southeast of Craigie village, in the Civil Parish of Craigie, South Ayrshire, Scotland.[1] The castle is recognised as one of the earliest buildings in the county.[2] It lies about 1.25 miles (2 km) west-south-west of Craigie church.[3] Craigie Castle is protected as a scheduled monument.[4]\nHistory of Craigie Castle\nCraigie Castle, Gaelic Caisteil Chreagaidh, was originally built for the Lyndesay or Lindsay clan. The castle passed to John Wallace of Riccarton through marriage about 1371 as the last heir was a daughter. This line of the Ayrshire Wallaces then lived at Craigie Castle until they moved to Newton Castle in Ayr in 1588. Craigie Castle was then left to fall into ruin.[5][6] It was the belief of Mrs Frances Dunlop of Dunlop, a lineal descendant of William Wallace, that he was born at his grandfather's home of Craigie Castle. William only moved away after a number of years had passed due to the burgeoning size of the family and the lack of space at Craigie.[7]\nDescriptions of the castle\nCraigie Castle from Craigie Mains farm\nThe south facing wall of the keep showing high quality stonework\nPart of a courtyard wall.\nThe present Gothic castellated ruins date mainly from the 15th century,[8] with some 12th or 13th century work. Another view is that the main part of the building was a hall house dating from the 12th or 13th century, incorporating an even earlier building[9] which may have been built by the predecessors of Walter Hose who held sway prior to Anglo-Norman control.[10]\nThe buildings were surrounded by ditches and natural lochans; enclosing an area of about 4 acres (16,000 m2). It had a high quality rib-vaulted hall consisting of three bays over an unvaulted basement, but architectural historians have found traces of an earlier hall which had a crenellated parapet rising flush with the main wall-face. In the centre of one wall was a round-arched doorway, and opposite this a late medieval fireplace, added in the 15th century, was built over another round-arched opening.\nThe castle contains one of the finest examples of a vaulted hall in Scotland, easily equal to any Scottish abbey or church. The only rivals of the same period are Tulliallan, Bothwell, and Auchendoun.[11] It has been stated that in its time Craigie was the most impressive building of its kind in Ayrshire.[12]\nDue to the condition of the structures it has proved difficult to determine the original plan, but the remains suggest that it was originally a simple rectangle of suitable size for a building such as an early hall-house. Craigie Castle may originally have been a hall-house of the late 12th or early 13th century with a wide crenellate parapet enclosing a saddleback roof. During the 15th century it seems that these crenellations were built over and a new hall fashioned on the walls of its predecessor.[13]\nThe ruins stand upon a knoll rising out of a plateau, between what appears to have been two marshes or lochans, and the ditches were originally cut between them. One ditch cuts the ridge 117m NE of the castle to form an outer bailey. The castle would have been effectively isolated from the 'mainland', and a significant barrier raised by the water to any potential besiegers at the period when the use of gunpowder was unknown. Two crumbling gables, portions of walls, and shreds of battlements remain, and in the 19th century several underground vaulted chambers survived, although partly filled with rubbish, and home to foxes and bats.[14] The entrance to the castle was at the south-west side by a drawbridge,[15] of which the abutment still survives.[16] The entrance pend or arched passage had a circular watch-tower or bastion to defend it. Within the closing wall was a courtyard surrounded by buildings, and from this courtyard there was an entrance into the great hall, long blocked up.[17]\nA plan of the castle.\nIn 1895 Smith records that at a distance of 145 paces from to the north-east of the castle a deep trench has been cut in a north-west and south-east direction for a distance of 162 paces, to connect the two lochans. Near the south wall of the castle there is another trench, and a section of building is to be seen on the outside of it. On the west side there are the remains of a third trench.[18]\nIn 1863 Paterson records that the tower was undergoing some repairs at the end of the 17th century when a part of the roof fell in, after which the castle was completely abandoned. He praises the high degree of military science employed in the construction of the castle where besiegers would be exposed to raking crossfire even after crossing the ditches / moats and would be outflanked on nearly all sides.[19]\nA 'Kragy' castle is marked on Timothy Pont's map of c.1600. It is shown on an elevated area with a prominent entrance way, wooded policies and a surrounding pale.[20]\nAlthough now a minor road, the road running near the castle (B730) was the main route from Irvine to Dumfries via Sanquhar, with a nearby link to the Ayr–Kilmarnock road; Craigie was therefore on one of the few reasonable standard communication routes in the area in the 18th and earlier centuries. The numerous rigs on Roy's 1752 map show that the whole area was intensively cultivated at the time.[21]\nCrannog\nWilliam Aiton's map of 1811 showing Craigie.\nAs late as the 19th century a likely crannóg was visible in the boggy hollow 'just to the south-west' of Craigie Castle; it was described as a slight rise in the meadow...mostly composed of stones. When the hollow was drained an oar was found.[22][23]\nMoot hills\nSmith records moot hills near Craigie village, Knockmarloch and Highlangside. The barony would originally have had a Moot or Justice Hill and a gallows hill.[24]\nBorland Farms\nThree Borland Farms have been recorded near Craigie village and this may relate directly to Craigie Castle. The name 'Boarland' could refer to the presence of wild boar, however a more likely origin is that a 'Boor' also meant a serf and Norman lords often apportioned lands near their castles for their servants.[25] The Borland or Bordland also meant the land that was specifically used to furnish food for a castle.[26] A 'Boirland' is marked on the Timothy Pont map as far back as the late 16th / early 17th century.[20]\nCraigie Mains farm\nThe conjoined Lindsay and Wallace Coats of Arms with supporters.\nDetail of the conjoined Wallace and Lindsay arms.\nAn armorial plaque from the castle ruins[15] is set in the wall of the steading (NS 4 062 3174). The naive peasantry at one time believed that the stone showed two wild men playing at draughts.[27] It bears the impaled arms of the Lindsays and Wallaces.\nJames Kilpatrick of Craigie Mains was a great horseman who considerably improved the breeding lines of the Clydesdale horse[28] and was famous throughout Britain and the World. Some his champions were: 1918, Craigie Litigant; 1921, Craigie Excellence; 1924, Craigie McQuaid; 1925, Craigie Exquisite; 1929, Craigie Winalot; 1930, Craigie Beau Ideal; 1933, Craigie Realisation; 1935, Craigie Magnificent; 1939, Craigie Independent; 1941, Craigie Topsman; 1942, Craigie Chieftain; 1947, Craigie Supreme Commander; 1948, Craigie True Form. In 1951 Craigie Mains had about 80 head of horses.[29] James Kilpatrick regularly exhibited his Clydesdales, colts and fillies in all their finery at the annual Craigie Agricultural Show in the 1900s.[30]\nThe famous 'Baron of Buchlyvie' was purchased for £700 by Mr Kilpatrick in 1902 and was the stud horse at the mains in 1903. Mr William Dunlop of Dunure Mains had a half share and after much disagreement the 'baron' ended up at Dunlop Mains, having been sold at auction or £9,500; an unheard of sum for a Clydesdale at the time. The mounted skeleton of this horse is now on display at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow.[31]\nMatthew Anderson the 'Policeman Poet' wrote a poem in honour of Symington and Craigie.\nThis is an extract –\n\"The greatest place beneath the sky,\nFor Clydesdale horse and Ayrshire Kye,\nIn all the bliss of perfect joy,\nThey roam the fields sae lovely.\nThere's Craigie Mains and Laigh Langside,\nIn them we feel a special pride,\nTheir name and fame are World wide.\nThen hip, hurrah for Craigie!\"[32]\nThe Hoses and Lindsays of Craigie\nIn the 12th century Walter fitz Alan, Steward of Scotland, held these lands and Walter Hose held his fief from the Steward.[10] In 1177 Walter Hose of Cragyn had given the church of Cragyn to the monks of Paisley. John, probably Walter's son, inherited and his son Thomas had no heir, resulting in his sisters Christiana and Matilda inheriting. Walter de Lyndesay, Knight, was the son of Christiana, the father being William Lyndesey of Crawfurd. The male line ended with John de Lyndesey, whose daughter married John Wallace of Riccarton.[33] A view of the keep facing North The keep from the South East The keep and great hall The South facing wall of the keep Craigie Castle in 1850 A view of Craigie Castle in its landscape from Barnweill Kirk ruins.\nThe Wallaces of Craigie\nCraigie Castle in the 1860s\nAn east view of the Great Hall\nThe Great Hall – detail\nJohn Wallace of Riccarton in the reign of David II had a charter of lands of Moorlecere in Forfarshire and was styled 'Wallayis of Richardtoun'. John married the heiress of Lindsay of Craigie circa 1371 and from this date Craigie was the chief residence of the family.[34]\nJohn Wallace was Lieutenant-General to James II, and fought at the Battle of Sark on 23 October 1448, killing the English General Magnus with his own hands. John was injured on the battlefield and died of his wounds at Craigie Castle about three months later.[15]\nIn the second half of the 15th century the Wallace family had Blind Harry write his poem The Wallace, which recorded the story of Sir William Wallace, albeit 150 years after his death.[35]\nAn Adam Wallace was Comptroller of the Household of James III in 1468.[36] John Wallace was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513; his brother Adam inherited and became oversmen of Prestwick in addition to Bailie of Kyle Stewart. In 1515 he was made alderman of Ayr and controlled the Royal Burgh for a decade.[37]\nIn 1559 Sir John Wallace accompanied the Earl of Glencairn, the Lords Boyd and Ochiltree, the Sheriff of Ayr, the Laird of Cessnock and others, with a body of 2500 men to Perth in support of the Covenanters or reformers.[38]\nSir William Wallace commanded a cavalry under James VII (James II of England) and went into exile in France with him.[15] He was at the Battle of Killiecrankie and died circa 1700; his brother succeeded to the estates, much impoverished by Sir William's adherence to the Jacobite cause.[39]\nWallace of Craigie coat of arms and supporters\nThe Wallaces of Craigie became hereditary Bailies of Kyle Stewart and as such were the chief local representatives of the Crown. In 1489 John Wallace obtained a lease to mine coal near Kingcase in Prestwick.[37]\nIn 1527 Gilbert Kennedy, 2nd Earl of Cassillis was ambushed and murdered on the sand dunes at Prestwick. Adam Wallace was implicated in this essentially Campbell inspired feud, as his wife, Dame Isabelle, was said to have planned the assassination. The controversy resulted in a loss of prestige and influence.[40]\nSir Hugh Wallace was a supporter of the Royalist cause of Charles I and II, for which his estate was sequestered and only returned when Charles II came to the throne. Sir Hugh had raised a regiment of foot at his own expense,[41] resulting in great debts, sale of lands and in 1626 the disposal of the heritable Kyle bailieship to the Crown for £10,000 Scots.[42] Sir Hugh Wallace, the laird referred to below, was knighted by Charles I and in 1669 Charles II conferred a Baronetcy upon him. All his sons predeceased him and Thomas, a grandnephew inherited.[43] He was most liberal in his ideas, fought with Montrose at the Battle of Philiphaugh and died about 1650.[41][44]\nIn 1770 Sir Thomas Wallace died and the baronetcy was inherited by his grandson Thomas Dunlop, who sold off the estate of Craigie in 1783,[45] moved to England and died within three years. He adopted the name Wallace, his mother being Frances Anne Wallace of Dunlop, Sir Thomas's daughter and sole heir; his father was John Dunlop of that Ilk. His son was Major-General Sir John Alexander Wallace who fought in India, Egypt, Spain and France and died in 1857.[46]\nThe Wallaces married into a number of local aristocratic families, notably the Campbells of Loudoun and the Blairs of Blair. At Blair Castle above a door are the armorial bearings of the Blairs Of Blair and the Wallaces of Craigie, dated 1617. Bryce Blair married Annabel Wallace.[47]\nIn the 1560s the Wallace family acquired Fail Monastery, however it was later granted to Walter Whytford and passed out of their hands.[48]\nCoat of arms\nWallace and Lyndsay Coat of Arms and supporters.\nThose of Sir John Alexander Wallace were quarterly : first and fourth, Gules, a Lion rampant, Or, within an Orle; second and third, Gules, a fesse Cheque of three, Argent and Azure. The Supporters were two savages, proper, with Clubs erect. The family crest was an Ostrich neck and head erect, issuing out of an open crown, with a horseshoe in the mouth. The motto was Esperanza, Spanish for 'Hope'.[49]\nThe legend of the fall of the Wallaces of Craigie\nThe Lairds of Craigie are said to have cared little for the religious discipline of the presbyterians, and the Laird of Craigie, Sir Hugh Wallace, allowed his tenants or servants to work on Sundays, and he himself traveled openly upon the Sabbath day. The other local ministers of the places involved wrote to the Laird's local minister, Mr. Inglish, about such open and scandalous breaches of the Sabbath.\nThe Laird ignored the ministers' advice and when in church he actually threw his sword at the minister, the sword sticking in the wood at the back of the pulpit. The minister recovered and told the Laird that God will reduce your great stone house to a pile of stones and no one will be able to repair it; and your son, of whom you have great hopes, will die a fool. Before long the castle was in need of repair, and when the stonemasons started work a great part of it fell down and had almost buried them all.[41][44] The story may have a grain of truth as Sir Hugh, as stated, was an ardent supporter of the episcopalian sentiments of Charles I and II and was no friend of the Presbyterians.\nCraigie House\nCraigie House\nMrs. Frances Dunlop of Dunlop, Patron and correspondent of Robert Burns.[50][51] She was the daughter and sole heiress to Sir Thomas Wallace of Craigie.\nIn the 1730s, Craigie House (NGR NS 34970 21386) in Ayr was built as a replacement residence for Sir Thomas Wallace of Newton-on-Ayr Castle, the fifth baronet; nothing of Newton Castle, previously known as Sanquhar,[21] now remains. In 1783 William Campbell, who made his fortune in India, purchased the principal portion of the Craigie estate. His brother, Richard Campbell of Craigie inherited the estate in 1823 and the property remained in the Campbell family for a number of generations.[52] The family included lawyers and politicians, one being the Member for the Ayr Burghs.[53]\nCraigie House and estate was purchased from the Campbell family by Ayr Town Council in 1940. The gardens that run from the centre of Ayr northeast alongside the River Ayr are open to the public free of charge, however the house is used as offices for the University of the West of Scotland and various building works are proposed for the gardens area.[5]\nNewton-on-Ayr Castle or Sanquhar Castle\nThe Wallaces constructed this castle, previously known as Sanquhar, circa the 15th century, however James V granted it to Sir William Hamilton, Provost of Ayr in 1539. William Hamilton of Sanquhar became a favourite of Regent Arran and Captain of Edinburgh Castle. His daughter Isobel married George Seton, 7th Lord Seton in August 1550 and the wedding feast was held at Edinburgh Castle. Inventories of Newton Sanquhar castle mention the fine carved furniture made in the \"most courtly manner\" that Hamilton had installed.[54]\nJohn Wallace of Craigie with forty others forcefully regained the castle in 1559 but were compelled to return it to the Hamiltons. It was returned to John Wallace of Burnbank, but was then occupied in 1587 by James Stewart, Earl of Arran, now called \"James Stewart of Sanquhar\", his brother Harry Stewart, and his wife Elizabeth Stewart, Lady Lovat.[55]\nIn 1598 the Wallaces confirmed their ownership and moved in shortly after. The castle was severely damaged in a storm in 1701 and was finally demolished in the second half of the 18th century. Nothing of the tower now remains.[56]\nMicro-history\nThe Eglinton Hunt regularly visited Craigie's hill, cover, knowes and glens in the 1900s. A kill resulted in a meal for the dogs and the bushy tail presented to the first lady.[57]\nThe small loch below the manse was used as the curling pond in the 1900s; the curling house ruins are still standing (2009).[58]\nIn 1584 William Wallace of Ellerslie held the lands of Mains of Helentoun and Bogend, together with the tower, fortalice, and manor place of Helenton, together with half of the mill.[59]\nSee also\nAuchans, Ayrshire, a Wallace castle\nEarlston, East Ayrshire\nReferences\nNotes\nSources\nAdamson, Archibald R.

    "text": "Castle in South Ayrshire, Scotland\nThis article is about the castle in South Ayrshire. For the castle in Kintyre, see Dundonald Castle, Kintyre.\nDundonald Castle is situated on a hill overlooking the village of Dundonald, between Kilmarnock and Troon in South Ayrshire, Scotland. Dundonald Castle is a fortified tower house built for Robert II on his accession to the throne of Scotland in 1371 and it was used as a royal residence by Robert II and his son Robert III.\nHistory\nDark age hill fort\nThe present castle stands on land where evidence suggests there was a hill fort. It is thought that a mixture of large timber-built roundhouse and straight-sided structures occupied the interior. A timber-laced stone rampart defined and defended the fort. The timber lacing caught fire and burnt with such intensity that the surrounding stonework melted, or vitrified. This firing happened about 1000 AD and seems to mark the end of the hill-fort’s existence.[citation needed] It was about this date that the British Kingdom of Strathclyde ceased to exist, being absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland.\nThe place name Dundonald means \"fort of Donald\". It appears to be derived from the British *Din Dyfnwal (the British personal name Dyfnwal is cognate to the Scottish Gaelic Dòmhnall and English Donald). The eponym of the fortress is unknown, although he may have been any of the numerous kings of Alt Clut/Strathclyde who bore the name Dyfnwal from the eighth century to the tenth century.\nEarly castles\nThere have been three medieval castles present on this site. The first was built by one of the stewards of the king of Scots, most probably Walter, the first steward, who came to Scotland in 1136. There is no surviving evidence of this castle above ground today.\nThe second castle was built in the late 13th century by Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward, this castle was predominantly built of stone. It would have been one of the grandest baronial residences of its time. It was largely destroyed by the Scottish during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the early 14th century. King Robert the Bruce's policy was to slight (demolish) most castles so they could not be used by enemies including much greater castles than Dundonald, such as Edinburgh Castle and Roxburgh Castle.[1] There is little remaining of this castle, however there is a well and a rounded stump of a tower near to the present.\nThe present castle\nDundonald Castle in 1903.\nThe third castle was built by Robert Stewart, probably to mark his accession to the throne as Robert II in 1371. It was three storeys high.\nThe top floor above the lofty stone vault was the upper hall – the great hall. It was for the more private use of the king and family. The first floor was the lower of the two halls – the laigh hall. It would have been used for more public activities like feasting and the holding of the baron court. The ground floor was a storage area. It was probably originally subdivided providing cellars for different commodities like wine, ale, foodstuffs and fuel.\nThe tower house was extended in the late 14th century to add additional private chambers and a prison. The outer courtyard (called more properly the barmkin) was completed and ancillary buildings (stables, bakehouses, brewhouses, smithy, etc.) built against the barmkin wall.\nThe third castle comprised almost everything that is visible above ground today, including the tower which dominates the hill.\nDundonald castle once had its own chapel dedicated to Saint Inan.[2]\nAuchens House\nMain article: Auchans Castle, Ayrshire\nBy 1520 the castle was in the possession of the Wallaces of Craigie. In 1536 King James V granted the castle and its estates to Robert Boyd, but he was unable to gain possession and, after a second, failed attempt at eviction, Boyd ceded control to the Wallace family.[3] A century later, debt forced the Wallaces to sell the castle in 1632, although by that time the family had moved its main residence to Auchens House, which they had built in the 1580s, in part with materials removed from Dundonald. The buyer was James Mathieson. He sold out to Sir William Cochrane in 1638, when Cochrane also bought Auchens House.[4]\nIn 1669 Cochrane was created the first Earl of Dundonald for his support to the Royalist cause in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.[5] In 1726 the Cochranes sold their Dundonald estate but retained possession of the ruined castle. In 1953 the 13th Earl gave the castle to the state which began a programme of reconstruction.[6]\nThe castle today\nThere is a visitor centre at the foot of the hill, which includes a cafe, souvenir shop and an interpretive exhibition. The exhibition outlines the history of the castle and its preceding buildings with detailed models of the earlier castles on the site.\nThe visitor centre is owned by South Ayrshire Council and the castle is owned by Historic Scotland. Both the castle and the visitor centre are operated by the Friends of Dundonald Castle.[7] The castle was made a scheduled monument[8] in 1920 and the schedule was updated in 2017.\nA ley tunnel is said to run from Seagate Castle in Irvine to Dundonald Castle.[9]\nArchaeology\nMinor archaeological investigations took place at Dundonald in the 1960s. These established that the rubble base was up to 4 feet in depth and rested on bedrock, which had been deliberately levelled with stones to form a cobbled surface. The curtain wall of the inner courtyard was shown to have been butted on to the keep, and rested on bedrock without any footings. The keep would seem to be resting on ashlar footings or underpinnings, a single course projecting in front of the castle wall. Part of this was pointed with mortar of nineteenth century date, probably contemporary with the consolidation work carried out at that period. There were no significant finds.[10]\nThree main seasons of archaeological excavation were completed between 1986 and 1988, in advance of a programme of conservation. Subsequently a series of smaller-scale excavations were undertaken finishing in 1993.[11] These excavations were led by Gordon Ewart (Kirkdale Archaeology) and focussed on the area within the barmkin enclosure of the present castle. They discovered material indicating multiple periods of occupation, dating back to the Bronze Age.\nThe material discovered relates to:\nCharcoal-rich layers, possibly Neolithic.\nKiln-like structures and a scatter of Bronze Age pottery fragments, the disturbance of which suggests successive phases of a permanent settlement.\nGrains including emmer wheat, which can be present at sites from the Neolithic through to the Iron Age.\nIron Age Hillfort with several large wooden roundhouses and a fragment of palisade on the lower terrace to the north of the exposed drystone circuit. Successive building on each of the house sites shows an extended period of occupation.\nShale or lignite bracelets and glass beads suggest the settlement continued to the 4th and 5th centuries AD.\nIn 2017-18 Historic Environment Scotland (HES) worked in partnership with the Friends of Dundonald Castle on proposals to raise public awareness of the castle as part of the Dundonald Heritage Project. It was hoped that new evaluation would shed valuable light on the development of the site through time, as well as providing a catalyst for continuing local community engagement.[12]\nThe investigation consisted of a geophysical survey (resistivity, gradiometry and ground-penetrating radar) performed by Rose Geophysics in early 2017, with subsequent public engagement events during Archaeology Month (September). This was followed by a series of excavations, including public engagement, carried out in August 2018 by HES Cultural Resources Team archaeologists along with CFA Archaeology.[13]\nLegend\nThe following extract alludes to an old Scottish folktale about the construction and origins of Dundonald Castle: In Ayrshire there is an unknown rhyme that is probably very old: Donald Din Built his house without a pin,\nalluding to Dundonald Castle, the ancient seat of King Robert II, and now the last remaining property in Ayrshire of the noble family who take their title from it. According to tradition, it was built by a hero named Donald Din, or Din Donald, and constructed entirely of stone, without the use of wood, a supposition countenanced by the appearance of the building, which consists of three distinct stories, arched over with strong stonework, the roof of one forming the floor of another.\nDonald, the builder, was originally a poor man, but had the faculty of dreaming lucking dreams. Upon one occasion he dreamed, thrice in one night, that if he were to go to London Bridge, he would become a wealthy man. He went accordingly, saw a man looking over the parapet of the bridge, whom he accosted courteously, and, after a little conversation, entrusted with the secret of the occasion of his coming to London Bridge.\nThe stranger told him that he had made a very foolish errand, for he himself had once had a similar vision, which directed him to go to a certain spot in Ayrshire, in Scotland, where he would find a vast treasure, and, for his part, he had never once thought of obeying the injunction.\nFrom his description of the spot, the sly Scotsman at once perceived that the treasure in question must be concealed in no other place than his own humble kail-yard [cabbage patch] at home, to which he immediately repaired, in full expectation of finding it. Nor was he disappointed; for, after destroying many good and promising cabbages, and completely cracking credit with his wife, who esteemed him mad, he found a large potful of gold coin, with the proceeds of which he built a stout castle for himself, and became the founder of a flourishing family.[14]\nLegend origins\nMain article: The Alchemist (book) § Inspiration\nSimilar legends can be found throughout Europe and the Middle-East.[15] The earliest version is one of the poems of the Mathanawi titled \"In Baghdad, Dreaming of Cairo: In Cairo, Dreaming of Baghdad\", by 13th century Persian poet Jalal al-Din Rumi;.[16] This poem was turned into a story in the tale from The One Thousand and One Nights: The man who became rich through a dream;[17] and spread through various countries folklore, children's tales and literature. More recently the story was adapted into the plot of the novel The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho.\nIn popular culture\nDundonald Castle features in the Jules Verne novel The Underground City.[18] The castle is used as a beacon to drive ships into the coast, where the beacon lighters can then steal the cargo of the stricken ship. Within the novel, the castle is also linked to an underground city beneath Loch Katrine via a tunnel, perhaps adding to the common myth of the ley tunnel.\nImages\nReferences\nSources\nForbes, David; Murray, Keir (2012).

    "text": "Dunure Castle is located on the west coast of Scotland, in South Ayrshire, about five miles (eight kilometres) south of Ayr and close to the village of Dunure. Today the castle stands in ruins on a rocky promontory on the Carrick coast, overlooking the small harbour of Dunure.\nIntroduction\nThe site dates from the late 13th century; the earliest charter for the lands dating from 1256, but the remains of the building are of 15th- and 16th-century origin.[1] One tradition says that the castle was built by the Danes. Another claims that the Mackinnons held the castle from Alexander III as a reward for their valour at the Battle of Largs.[2][3]\nThe castle is the point of origin of the Kennedys of Carrick (not to be confused with the American Kennedy family), who once ruled over much of south western Scotland and were granted the lands in 1357. Sir James Balfour described Dunure as \"a grate and pleasand stronge housse, the most ancient habitation of the surname of Kennedy, Lairds of Dunure, now Earles of Cassiles.\"[4]\nIn August 1563, Mary, Queen of Scots, visited the castle for three days during her third progress round the west of the country.[5]\nThe Celtic name Dunure or Dunoure is said to derive from the \"hill\" or \"fort of the yew tree\".[6]\nRoasting of the Commendator of Crossraguel\nWilliam Aiton's 1811 map showing Dunure.\nIn 1570, a dispute arose between Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis, and Allan Stewart, the succeeding lay Commendator of Crossraguel Abbey, over the ownership of some of the abbey lands and their rental income. The Earl's uncle was Quintin Kennedy, the last true abbot of Crossraguel. Quintin challenged John Knox to a debate on the Catholic Mass.[7] Gilbert had expected to secure the Commendatorship,[8] however Allan obtained it through the influence of his relative, Captain James Stewart of Cardonald.[9] Gilbert, with sixteen men,[10] caught Allan Stewart unexpectedly in Crossraguel Woods whilst a guest of the Laird of Bargany,[2] and tricked him [11] into journeying to Dunure. At the castle, he was deprived of his horse and weapons and guarded by six of the Earl's men.[12]\nFor two days, Gilbert left the commendator to consider his fate and because he was obstinate and refused to sign over the lands and rentals, Gilbert tortured him twice, roasting and basting his feet and body over a brazier in the Black Vault[13] of the castle,[14] aided by his cook, baker and pantrymen.[15] As a result of the torture sessions of the first and seventh days of September 1570,[16] the lands were signed over to Gilbert.\nThe Commendator was rescued from his confinement by the Laird of Bargany, Allan's brother in law, who arrived with a body of men; first hiding in the chapel and then storming the castle.[17] The rights to the abbey lands were settled, partly by the Earl providing Allen Stewart with sufficient funds to allow him to live 'comfortably' for the rest of his life.[1] In the meantime, he had been taken to the Cross of Ayr where he had denounced the Earl of Cassillis.[18] The Earl was never fully brought to book for his actions by the Privy Council. Allen Stewart never walked again.[19]\nThe castle and estate of Dunure, together with Dalquharran, were purchased by Sir Thomas Kennedy of Kirkhill in the late 17th century.[1]\nUsage and demise\nThe castle in 1789\nThe castle keep in 1789[20]\nThe castle consisted of two distinct parts; a keep of an irregular shape on the top of a precipitous rock and other buildings at a lower level. The keep walls are about five feet thick and the vaults on the basement are well preserved, however most of the superstructure is entirely demolished. The keep represents the original castle, much altered. The central portion of the castle may be 15th century and was intended to form a defence to the access into the keep. The additional buildings are of a later date and contain two kitchens on the ground level, one for the castle and the other for the retainers. To the north-east stands a detached wall which may have led to a gateway. A drawbridge may have stood nearby and the chapel may have been located against the thick wall of the central part of the castle.[14] A moat or fosse protected the approach and a wall may have also existed.[3]\nIn the 1990s, excavations showed that a hall house was built across the 13th century court in the 14th century.[21]\nBeneath the castle is a cavern called the Browney's Cave which may have been a sally-port: a secret tunnel leading to the castle.[22]\nIn 1429 a meeting took place at Dunure between James Campbell, representing King James I of Scotland and John Mor MacDonald, representing the Lord of the Isles. Violence broke out and MacDonald was killed. James I's efforts to contain the outrage of the Lords of the Isles by executing Campbell did not prevent a subsequent uprising by them. For three days from 4 August 1563, Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed at Dunure Castle on her Royal tour down the west coast to Glenluce Abbey then on to Whithorn Priory. She was the guest of Gilbert Kennedy, the 4th Earl of Cassilis.[5]\nDoocot\nThe late medieval \"beehive\"-shaped dovecot of Dunure Castle dates probably from the 15th century. It would have held some 200 nesting boxes and would have supplied the castle with fresh eggs and meat.[23]\nDemise\nDunure and the castle in 1840\nDunure Castle and headland from the south.\nThe castle's demise began in the mid-17th century. By 1694, the castle was described as \"wholly ruined\". It is not clear whether this can be linked to the Civil War period, although local tradition suggests that Dunure had been burnt and/or blown up. A major collapse of the southeastern part of the keep could perhaps be linked to such activity. Recovery of building materials for the construction of the Cromwellian citadel in Ayr may also account for its ruination, as occurred at Ardrossan Castle. Much evidence exists for the systematic dismantling of the structure for recoverable building materials including the orderly removal of slates, stone, and glass. The windows were dismantled and comprehensively stripped of their lead. Remains of a localised fire and associated deposits of coal suggested that smelting of the lead took place within the room. Those dismantling the castle seem to have occupied part of the structure during their work.\nThe ruin subsequently saw periodic robbing of its sandstone dressings. A range of castle buildings to the south of Area 4 remained in occupation until c. 1860. Census records and reuse of some rooms demonstrate that some of the occupants were fishermen. A large midden of mussel shell gave evidence for the baiting of cod lines. Domestic refuse of the later 18th and early to mid-19th century was also recovered. The only relatively late recorded military action at Dunure consists of a short siege in 1570. A Civil War action or slighting is a further possibility, although the castle may have been abandoned by that time. The route of a stone-lined water course was located at the south end of the trench as it ran into the entrance of the Area 4 kitchen range. Groundworks to the south of the ruins located a further, well preserved section of the same water course.[24]\nPresent day\nThe castle has been excavated and consolidated, making safe the public access to the area. The castle dominates the Kennedy Park, which has a number of facilities for visitors. There are also said to be secret Ley tunnels which connect Dunure Castle to Greenan Castle further north.\nMicro-history\nIn the story \"The Brownie of Dunure,\" Sir Thomas Kennedy of Dunure adopts the son of his neighbour and kinsman, Reginald Duff, Laird of Dunduff. Sir Thomas has an illegitimate daughter and he hopes that the two will marry. The O'Neils of Ireland are competitors for her hand and to ensure a love match, the legend of the Brownie of Dunure is employed with mixed results.[25]\nSee also\nDunduff Castle\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Dunure Castle.\nHistoric Environment Scotland. \"Dunure Castle and dovecot (SM6105)\".\nPictures of Dunure Village and Castle\nVideo footage of the Dunure Dovecote\n55°24′17″N 4°45′56″W / 55.4048°N 4.7655°W / 55.4048; -4.7655\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "The castle known as Gadgirth Old Ha' or Gadgirth Old Hall,[1][2] was the first castle at Gadgirth, held by the Chalmer family, standing on a whinstone promontory overlooking the River Ayr in the Parish of Coylton, the old district of Kyle, now part of South Ayrshire, Scotland.[3][4]\nLocation\nThis archaeological site lies on the southern side of the River Ayr near the B742 road that crosses the River Ayr at Gadgirth Bridge and runs up to Annbank.[4] The castle jutts into the river on a rocky promontory with an islet located within the river at this point.\nDescription\nOldhall Woods and the site of Old Ha'\nThe Gadgirth Old Ha' consists of a section of masonry held together with lime mortar set against the crag and another small section, circa 2.3m long and a maximum height of 1.5m high enclosing the area of circa 8.7m by 6m, apparently a corner of the building. On the sides not protected by the river are the remnants of a fosse, moat or ditch and a drawbridge is said to have been located here.[4][5] The approximate dimensions of the main wall are 5.5m in length and 3.5m height.[1]\nThe historian John Smith in the 1890s visited the site and stated that only a short stretch of wall could be traced. The other castle in the district was at Martnaham.[3]\nHistory\nLittle is known of the history of this castle site, once held by the ancestors of the Chalmer, originally the De Camera family, which was replaced by their later 14th century Gadgirth Castle that stood around 500 metres or a quarter of a mile upstream on the same southern side of the River Ayr until demolished in 1808.[3][6] Reginaldus de Camera (Chalmer) is recorded to have held the Barony of Gadgirth during the reign of William the Lion (1165-1214).[1]\nReferences\nNotes;\nBibliography\nCampbell, Thorbjorn (2003).

    "text": "Castle ruin in Ayrshire, Scotland\nTurnberry Castle is a fragmentary ruin on the coast of Kirkoswald parish, near Maybole in Ayrshire, Scotland.[2] Situated at the extremity of the lower peninsula within the parish, it was the seat of the Earls of Carrick. Turnberry Castle is adjacent to Turnberry Golf Course.\nHistory\nAs to when or by whom Turnberry was built there seems to be no authentic record; but it was originally a stronghold of the Lords of Galloway, and thence passed into the possession of the Earls of Carrick around the beginning of the 13th century.[3] In the late 13th century the castle belonged to Marjorie, the widowed Countess of Carrick. According to medieval legend, Marjorie held the visiting knight Robert de Brus captive until he agreed to marry her. The marriage between Marjorie and Robert in 1271 conveyed to him both the castle and the earldom. Their first son, also named Robert, went on to become \"Robert the Bruce\", the King of Scots. Although it is unknown whether Turnberry was his actual birthplace, the fact that he spent his boyhood residing in the castle is not in doubt.[4]\nTurnberry Castle is associated with two significant historical events, both of which are directly connected to Robert the Bruce. On 20 September 1286, several Scottish barons who supported the title of the Bruce as successor of the crown met secretly at Turnberry Castle. Robert was only 12 years old at the time.[5] The second event was the attempt made by Robert in the spring of 1307, to recover the castle from the English, who occupied it at the time. This attempt was only partially successful, although ultimately it led to the withdrawal of the English soldiers. His attempt to reclaim the castle marked the beginning of a long road, ending with Robert's eventual success at Bannockburn.[6] It was Robert the Bruce who ordered the destruction of the castle in 1310, to prevent it from falling once again into the hands of the English. The castle was nearly destroyed; the ruins that remain are part of the original castle as it does not appear to have been rebuilt.[7]\nDescription\nThere is little left of the old buildings today. Turnberry Castle is surrounded on three sides by the sea, and the landward side is occupied by a golf resort. The ruin has been affected by the actions of centuries of severe weather and erosion by the sea, leaving little more than its lower vaults and cellars intact. There are some vestiges of a drawbridge as well as an old portcullis which may have done duty as a gate. By the extent of the rock which seems to be included at the site, the castle appears to have been a fortress of great size and strength. There are also caves that lead out into the sea, that may have served the castle as a harbour. Turnberry lighthouse was built on part of the castle's site in 1873, and still stands today.[2]\nSee also\nScotland portalEngineering portal\nTurnberry Band\nMessage from Turnberry\nReferences\nExternal links\nArtist's conjectural reconstruction of Turnberry Castle\nThe Sirens Song – a legend about a fisherman sitting by Turnberry Castle watching the sunset Archived 30 April 2013 at the Wayback Machine\n55°19′34″N 4°50′39″W / 55.3261°N 4.8441°W / 55.3261; -4.8441\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Medieval castle in Scotland\nBothwell Castle is a large medieval castle, sited on a high, steep bank, above a bend in the River Clyde in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is located between Bothwell and Uddingston, about 10 miles (16 km) south-east of Glasgow. Construction of the castle was begun in the 13th century by the ancestors of Clan Murray, to guard a strategic crossing point of the Clyde. Bothwell played a key role in Scotland's Wars of Independence, changing hands several times.\nThe huge cylindrical donjon was built in the 13th century, but before the rest of the castle was completed it was severely damaged in a series of sieges. Rebuilding in the early 15th century enlarged the castle, but it was abandoned by the 18th century. The present ruin is rectangular, with the remains of the donjon to the west, and the later Great Hall to the east. The courtyard is enclosed by long curtain walls, with round towers at the south-east and south-west corners. The castle was described by Scottish archaeologist William Douglas Simpson as one of the \"foremost secular structures of the Middle Ages in Scotland\".[1]\nHistory\nKing David I granted the barony of Bothwell to David Olifard (or Olifant), Justiciar of Lothian, in the mid 12th century. The lands passed to his descendants including his daughter who had married William de Moravia son of William son of Freskin, who was deceased by 1226 circa. Then by 1252 the barony became the property of their son Walter de Moravia, or Walter of Moray He began construction of the castle, but by the start of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296, only the main donjon, the prison tower, and the short connecting curtain wall were completed. Foundations of the remainder were probably in place, and would have been defended by a wooden palisade.\nWars of Scottish Independence\nThe forces of King Edward I of England invaded Scotland at the start of the war, and seized Bothwell. The castle was at this time held by Walter's son, William Moray of Bothwell. The English garrison holding the castle was besieged by the Scots for 14 months in 1298—1299, and eventually capitulated. Edward I returned in 1301, capturing the castle once more with a force of 6800 men, and specially constructed siege engines. Bothwell became the headquarters of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, Edward's appointed Warden of Scotland, and remained in English hands for several years.\nPlan of Bothwell Castle\nFollowing Robert the Bruce's victory at Bannockburn in 1314, the castle provided shelter for several English nobles. However, the castle's constable, Sir Walter FitzGilbert, surrendered the castle to the approaching Scots. For this act, he was granted the barony of Cadzow, where his descendants became the powerful Hamilton family. The Scots slighted the castle after its surrender.[2]\nIn 1336 the English returned again, this time under Edward III. The English king had the castle repaired, and again made it his headquarters in Scotland. The following year, however, Sir Andrew Murray, great-nephew of Sir William and the rightful owner of Bothwell, recaptured the stronghold, again using siege engines. Following his victory he slighted the castle once more, pulling down the west side of the donjon and tumbling it into the Clyde, in order that it could not be reoccupied by the enemy. The castle remained derelict until the 1360s.\nDouglas\nIn 1362, Joan Moray of Bothwell, heiress of the Morays, married Archibald Douglas, nicknamed \"the Grim\" and later to be Lord of Galloway and Earl of Douglas. Douglas commenced rebuilding Bothwell, repairing the donjon and completing the walls. The work was continued by his son, Archibald, the 4th Earl. By 1424 they had constructed the Great Hall and adjacent chapel, with towers at the north-east and south-east corners, and curtain walls connecting to the donjon, enclosing the courtyard.\nThe \"Black\" Douglases were forfeited in 1455, and their lands returned to the crown. James III granted Bothwell to Lord Crichton, and then to Sir John Ramsay, who were both forfeited in turn. In 1488 Bothwell was granted again to Patrick Hepburn, 2nd Lord Hailes, and the Earldom of Bothwell was created for him. Hepburn did not retain Bothwell Castle for long, however, exchanging it with Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus, known as \"Bell-the-Cat\", in return for Hermitage Castle in Liddesdale. James IV visited Bothwell in 1503 and 1504.\nSouth East Tower seen from inside the roofless Great Hall in the mid-19th century (left) and in 1997 (right).\nBothwell thus reverted to the Douglases, and descended through the Earls of Angus and Marquesses of Douglas to the Earls of Forfar. Archibald Douglas, 1st Earl of Forfar, began construction of a new mansion nearby, demolishing the castle's north-east tower for its stone. (His house was demolished in 1926 due to mining subsidence in the area). After the death of the 2nd Earl at Sheriffmuir in 1715, the castle reverted to the senior line of the Douglas family, represented by the 1st Duke of Douglas and his heirs. The castle then descended to the Earls of Home. In 1935 the 13th Earl gave Bothwell into state care. It is now managed by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument, and was open to the public (with admission charge) until the castle was closed in 2020 due to safety issues.[3]\nDesign\nWhile the castle was never completed to its original design, its design is similar to the strongholds of Coucy, Kildrummy and Dirleton as it has a round keep (or donjon). The keep, while currently in ruins, was originally 82 feet (25 m) high and 62 feet (19 m) in diameter with walls which were 15 feet (4.6 m) thick.[2] Thick walls and a powerful gatehouse were later added to the structure and the castle was considered \"one of the most important military strongholds in Scotland\".[4]\nPopular culture\nThe castle features in The Scottish Chiefs.[5]\nReferences\nMason, Gordon The Castles of Glasgow and the Clyde, Goblinshead, 2000\nRutherford, Allan; Malcolm, John (2011), \"'That stalwart toure': Bothwell Castle in the Thirteenth and Early Fourteenth Centuries\", in Audrey Dakin; Miles Glendinning; Aonghus MacKechnie (eds.), Scotland's Castle Culture, Berlinn, ISBN 978-1-906566-33-3\nSalter, Mike The Castles of South West Scotland, Folly Publications, 1993\nTabraham, Chris (1994).

    "text": "Castle ruins in South Lanarkshire, Scotland\nCadzow Castle, seen across the Avon Gorge from the Duke's Bridge\nCadzow Castle, now in ruins, was constructed between 1500 and 1550 at a site one mile south-east of the centre of Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. The earlier medieval settlement of Hamilton was formerly known as Cadzow or Cadyou[1] (Middle Scots: Cadȝow), until it was renamed in 1455 in honour of James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton.[2] The castle sits above a gorge overlooking the Avon Water in what is now Chatelherault Country Park, but was previously the hunting and pleasure grounds of the duke of Hamilton's estate of Hamilton Palace - this area being known as Hamilton High Parks. The ruin is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[3]\nHistory\nThe early castle\nThe ancient kings of Strathclyde are believed to have had a hunting lodge at Cadzow, prior to that kingdom's assimilation into Scotland in the 12th century. The original Cadzow Castle is believed to have been built in the 12th century on an earlier high status site, as an occasional royal residence for King David I (1124–1153). Royal charters of David's reign were issued from here as early as 1139. His successors Alexander II, Alexander III and others down to Robert the Bruce also used the castle, it is believed primarily as a hunting lodge due to the close proximity of the forested parkland, itself part of the once more extensive royal forest of the Clyde Valley. Archaeologists favour the site of Hamilton Motte adjacent to the original settlement and religious foundation, and known latterly as Hamilton Motte. It is possible that the earlier Cadzow Castle was on an alternative site at NS729548, now known as Castlehill, although the area is now a housing estate, and the site is some distance from the settlement of Cadzow, and of dubious topographical prospects for such a fortification.\nThe ancient Cadzow oak woodland pasture, and Cadzow White Park cattle in the 19th century.\nThe estate of Cadzow was divided in 1222, with Cadzow Castle passing to the Comyns. Following the forfeiture of their lands for supporting John Balliol, the estate was granted by Robert the Bruce to Walter FitzGilbert de Hambeldon in the early 14th century. FitzGilbert was ennobled as the first Baron of Cadzow, and is the ancestor of the dukes of Hamilton. He constructed another fortification, which may represent the motte near the town (NS729548), which remains, adjacent to the M74 motorway.\nThe 16th-century castle\nThe present castle was built around 1530 by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, who also constructed nearby Craignethan Castle. James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran was confined here in April 1566 after four years in Edinburgh Castle, for an alleged plot against Mary, Queen of Scots.[4]\nFollowing her escape from Lochleven Castle in 1568, Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed here. As a result it was destroyed by forces of the Earl of Mar, regent for James VI, in the late 16th century, as retaliation against the Hamiltons for their support of Mary. It was partially rebuilt in the 18th century, to serve as a folly within the duke's park.\nThe castle today\nThe site is now owned and managed by Historic Environment Scotland. There is no public access to the ruins, as the structure is unstable, and largely supported by scaffolding. Footpaths within the country park allow visitors to view the ruin. The Duke's Bridge, built high across the Avon Gorge, offers the most dramatic view of the ruins above the wooded gorge. A series of excavations, sponsored by Historic Scotland, took place at the castle between 2000 and 2003 and demonstrated that no evidence was found to support an early medieval fortification at the site, nor any large settlement to compete with the traditional medieval settlement of Cadzow now adjacent to the M74 motorway, and in later centuries called the Netherton to distinguish it from the 'Hitoun' of Cadzow.\nReferences\n\"Cadzow Castle\".

    "text": "Castle in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, UK\nThis article is about the castle in Scotland. For the iron-age fort in Dorset, see Spetisbury Rings.The ruins of Crawford Castle\nCrawford Castle, substantially in ruins, is located on the north bank of the River Clyde, around 1⁄2 mile (800 metres) north of Crawford, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. The ruins stand on an earlier motte and bailey earthwork. The castle is also known as Lindsay Tower, after its former owners, the Lindsay family. The strategic location of the castle, at NS954213, guards the strategically important Mennock Pass from England into the upper Clyde Valley.\nHistory\nArchaeological excavations to the north-west of the castle have shown that a Roman fort, with a garrison of perhaps 300, existed at this site between 80 AD and 170 AD.[1]\nThis site was the administrative centre for the Barony of Crawford, at that time the largest and most influential barony in southern Scotland. The Barony was established before 1100 when records of the period show Sveinn as Lord of Crawford. Upon his death, his son Thor, Lord of Tranent and the Sheriff of Edinburghshire, is recorded as Lord of Crawford.[2] Crawford Castle was in existence by 1175,[3] and was probably built as an earthwork and timber castle some time before this by Thor,[4] or indeed by Thor's father Sveinn.\nThe Lindsay family inherited the barony of Crawford when William Lindsay married ca. 1154 the younger daughter of Thor, and granddaughter of Sveinn, Lord of Crawford or following the death of Thor in about 1165. It was probably William Lindsay who built the stone castle by 1175. He is recorded as Lord of Crawford by 1185x1190.[5] Crawford Castle is located in Crawford Parish. From an early date, the Clan Carmichael of Meadowflatt acted as hereditary constables of the castle, retaining this post under successive owners.\nIn 1398, Robert II granted the title of Earl of Crawford to David Lindsay, who had won great praise on St George’s Day, 23 April 1390 for bravery in a duel with the Englishman Baron Welles on London Bridge after Welles, as Champion of England, at a banquet in Edinburgh and presumably after too much alcohol, issued the challenge: \"Let words have no place; if ye know not the Chivalry and Valiant deeds of Englishmen; appoint me a day and a place where ye list, and ye shall have experience.\"[6]\nAt the accession of James IV in 1488 the barony of Crawford was transferred to Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus for supporting the young prince's rebellion against his father James III. The Earls of Angus held the castle until 1578, when their estates were forfeited by the young James V. James used Crawford as a hunting lodge until his own death in 1542. His mistress, Elizabeth Carmichael, was the daughter of the hereditary constable. She was the mother of John Stewart, Commendator of Coldingham. James V and Mary of Guise came to Crawford in July 1541 bringing tapestry to furnish their lodging at the castle. George Carmichael, son of the Captain of Crawford, presented three ounces of Scottish gold to the queen.[7]\nAfter 1542 the barony was returned to the Earls of Angus, the keepership of the Carmichaels of Meadowflatt coming to an end in 1595. In 1633 the 11th earl was created Marquess of Douglas, and the castle was probably rebuilt after this date. The castle then passed to the Duke of Hamilton, before being sold to Sir George Colebrooke in the 18th century. After a period of use as a farmhouse, the building was abandoned at the end of the 18th century, and much of the stone reused to build the present Crawford Castle Farm. Four stone tablets bearing coats of arms, one with the date 1648, are built into the west and south walls of the Castle Crawford House.[8]\nRuins\nCastle Crawford House, partially built using stone reclaimed from the nearby castle ruins.\nThe early earthworks of Crawford Castle comprise a motte around 5 m high, with a surrounding ditch and a bailey some 45 m by 33 m to the south-west. On the motte are the remains of a curtain wall, surrounding an enclosure around 20 m square. There may have been round towers at the corners of this enclosure, which probably dates to the 16th or early 17th centuries. A range of buildings on the south-west side of the castle were built at around the same time. This tower-like range was of three storeys, plus an attic, with a vaulted basement and projecting chimney-breast. To the south-east, a second range was added later in the 17th century, providing more spacious accommodation with larger windows. The prominent arched recess in the east wall suggests that a single storey building of some kind projected from the main structure at this location.[9] Much of the present remains probably date from the 17th century rebuilding by the Marquess of Douglas.\nCrawford Castle is specified in a list of monuments published by the Minister of Public Building and Works under the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913. It is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[10] The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland lists the site as a castle or motte.\nFootnotes\nReferences\nBlaeu Atlas of Scotland, 1654, p. 61 [1]\nCoventry, Martin The Castles of Scotland (3rd Edition), Goblinshead, 2001\nCrawfurd, G.

The first castle, erected in the 13th century, was destroyed and replaced several times until the 18th century when a large mansion house was built in its place. This too was demolished in 1938, and today only a single corner tower of the 17th-century castle remains. The castle was the former family seat of the Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home.

The remains are protected as a category C listed building.[1]\nHistory\nThe Douglas family built the first Douglas Castle, which was constructed of either wood or stone, sometime before 1288.[2] In 1307, during the Wars of Scottish Independence the castle was captured and garrisoned by the English under Lord Clifford. Sir James Douglas, companion of Robert the Bruce successfully recaptured his family seat by storming the castle on Palm Sunday, while the garrison were at chapel. He had the garrison killed and thrown into a cellar, before the structure was burned. The event has become known as \"Douglas' larder\".\nThe remains of the 17th-century castle, seen from the south-west\nRobert the Bruce rewarded Sir James's loyalty with vast holdings, and in 1357 Sir James' nephew, Sir William Douglas, was created the 1st Earls of Douglas/Earl of Douglas. In 1384, Sir James's illegitimate son, Sir Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Douglas/Archibald Douglas, became the 3rd Earl of Douglas, and Douglas Castle was rebuilt as one of the Douglas strongholds. In the 15th century, the power of the \"Black\" Douglases had come to threaten the Stewart monarchy. In 1455 James II led an expedition against the rebellious 9th Earl, defeating his forces at the battle of Arkinholm. Douglas Castle was sacked then and the family's lands and titles forfeited.\nThe \"Red\" Douglases, Earls of Angus, had sided with the king against the senior branch of their family, and it was they who gained the Douglas lands in Lanarkshire. It is likely that the castle was rebuilt soon after 1455. Regent Morton came to Douglasdale in June 1574 to survey the house of the Earl of Angus with a view to repairing it and living there.[3]\nIn 1703, Archibald Douglas, 3rd Marquess of Douglas was created Duke of Douglas, with his principal seat at Douglas Castle. The castle was again rebuilt around this time, as a tower house and an enclosed courtyard with a corner tower. This castle was destroyed by fire in 1755, with the exception of the corner tower.[4]\nFrom 1757, the Duke began construction of an enormous castellated mansion at Douglas. The architects of this, the final Douglas Castle, were the Adam Brothers (James Adam, John Adam, and Robert Adam). Had it been completed the castle would have been the largest in Scotland. As it was the Duke of Douglas died in 1761, and only around half of the original design was ever completed. The five-storey building had round towers to the front and square towers to the rear facade, and stood in a very extensive park spanning the valley of the Douglas Water. The Duke's estate became the subject of a famous and bitter legal dispute, known as the \"Douglas Cause\", between his nephew Archibald James Edward Douglas and the Duke of Hamilton. Douglas was eventually victorious and ennobled as Baron Douglas in 1790, and the castle descended through his daughter, and granddaughter, to the Earls of Home. In the 1930s Charles Douglas-Home, 13th Earl of Home allowed the mining of coal in the park adjacent to the castle, in an attempt to relieve desperate levels of local unemployment. The mining caused dangerous subsidence to the castle and it had to be demolished in 1938.\nThe castle today\nToday, only a ruined corner tower of the penultimate castle remains, built in the late 17th century. Three storeys and 9m in height, the tower once stood at the corner of an enclosure, estimated at around 40m across. The tower stands on a prominent rise in the valley, to the south of the river, and was retained as a garden folly when the later mansion was built. Below is a small cellar block with glazed tiles on the interior walls. Nothing visible remains of the mansion.[5]\nSir Walter Scott used the location and early history of Castle Douglas as the inspiration for his novel Castle Dangerous. The castle is still sometimes referred to by this alternative name.\nA former lodge to the castle is preserved in the Cairn Lodge service area on the M74.[citation needed]\nNotes\n^ Historic Environment Scotland. \"Douglas Estate Douglas Castle (Category C Listed Building) (LB1449)\".

Long since demolished, the castle lay high on the east bank of the River Clyde, near the confluence with the Mouse Water. The site is designated a scheduled monument.[1]\nAs a key strategic high point over the Clyde Valley, the Romans built a fortification on what is still known as Castle Hill, south west of the modern town centre.

However, this is most likely not accurate. At this time, Lanark was a part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde.

    "text": "Castle in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, UK\nLee Castle, also known as The Lee, is a castellated mansion in Auchenglen, a branch of the Clyde Valley in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is located 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) south of Braidwood, and 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) north-west of Lanark. Lee was the seat of the Lockharts of Lee from its establishment in the 13th century until 1919, though the present house is the result of rebuilding in the 19th century.\nThe house is protected as a category B listed building,[1] and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens.[2]\nHistory\nIn 1272, William Locard was granted the feudal barony of Lee.[2] His son, Sir Simon Locard (1300–1371), fought in the Wars of Scottish Independence, and afterward accompanied Sir James Douglas in his attempt to carry the heart of Robert the Bruce to the Holy Land in 1330. Following the death of Sir James Douglas in battle with the Moors in Spain, Sir Simon carried the Bruce's heart back to Scotland for burial at Melrose Abbey. He is said to have subsequently added the heart and fetterlock to the family coat of arms.[2] He also acquired the \"Lee Penny\", an amulet or touch piece said to have healing properties, and which remains in the family's possession.\nSir William Lockhart of Lee (1621–1675) fought for the Royalist cause in the English Civil War, but switched sides, and later married the niece of Oliver Cromwell. Lockhart was appointed Cromwell's commissioner for the administration of justice in Scotland, in 1652. He also served as English ambassador at the French court in 1656. His brother George Lockhart was appointed Lord Advocate, and he purchased the Lanarkshire estates of the Earl of Carnwath. Both Lee and Carnwath estates were inherited by his son Sir George Lockhart of Lee (1673–1731). He acted as a commissioner for the Act of Union between England and Scotland in 1707, but later adopted the Jacobite cause. He was involved in the Jacobite Rising of 1715 but escaped serious punishment. George's grandson, another George, fought with the Jacobites in the 1745 Rising, and afterwards went into exile. This George's younger brother James also went overseas, fighting in the Austrian army during the Seven Years' War. He inherited the Lee estates by staging the death of his traitorous older brother, and was made a Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1782. His nephew, Alexander Lockhart of Lee, member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed, was made a baronet in 1806.\nBy this time, the parklands around Lee Castle had been laid out, as recorded on William Roy's maps of the mid 18th century, although the form of the house at this time is unknown.[2] Sir Charles Lockhart, 2nd Baronet (1799–1832), built a new house at Lee in 1817, but shortly after his death Sir Norman Lockhart, 3rd Baronet (1802–1849), commissioned James Gillespie Graham to design a much larger house. Work began in 1834, incorporating the earlier building, and continued until 1845. The 5th baronet made changes to the parklands in the later 19th century,[2] but on his death in 1919 the baronetcy became extinct. In 1948 the house and estate passed out of the family, and were later split up in the 1970s. The feudal barony of Lee was granted by Petition to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's Representative in Scotland, the Lord Lyon, King of Arms to The Much Honoured Terence Alvis of Lee, 23rd Baron of Cam'nethan, 33rd Baron of Lee.\nBaron Alvis of Lee (33rd Baron) carried out major restoration to the house over a ten-year period and sold Lee Castle in 1987 to E. Leslie Peter,[3][4] a Canadian USA-based businessman and philanthropist,[5] who purchased the Lordship of Lee[5] and was known to be a generous benefactor to the Westminster Abbey restoration appeal.[5] In 2004 the house, along with around 250 acres (100 ha)[6] / 261 acres (106 ha)[7] of land and the feudal caput, was put up for sale on the internet site eBay,[6] although this was unsuccessful. The house was sold a few months later for an all-time record price for a private Scottish residence to Addison Fischer, an American tycoon.[8][9]\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Lee Castle, South Lanarkshire.\nLee Castle website\nLee Castle, Lanark Scotland, American Clan Lockhart Society\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

    "text": "Castle in Scotland\nFor ships named after the castle, see Stirling Castle (disambiguation).\nStirling Castle, located in Stirling, is one of the largest and most historically and architecturally important castles in Scotland. The castle sits atop an intrusive crag, which forms part of the Stirling Sill geological formation. It is surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs, giving it a strong defensive position. Its strategic location, guarding what was, until the 1890s, the farthest downstream crossing of the River Forth, has made it an important fortification in the region from the earliest times.\nMost of the principal buildings of the castle date from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. A few structures remain from the fourteenth century, while the outer defences fronting the town date from the early eighteenth century.\nBefore the union with England, Stirling Castle was also one of the most used of the many Scottish royal residences, very much a palace as well as a fortress. Several Scottish Kings and Queens have been crowned at Stirling, including Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1542, and others were born or died there.\nThere have been at least eight sieges of Stirling Castle, including several during the Wars of Scottish Independence, with the last being in 1746, when Bonnie Prince Charlie unsuccessfully tried to take the castle. Stirling Castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and is now a tourist attraction managed by Historic Environment Scotland.\nHistory\nEarly history\nCastle Hill, on which Stirling Castle is built, forms part of the Stirling Sill, a formation of quartz-dolerite around 350 million years old, which was subsequently modified by glaciation to form a \"crag and tail\".[1] It is likely that this natural feature was occupied at an early date, as a hill fort is located on Gowan Hill, immediately to the east.[2]\nThe Romans bypassed Stirling, building a fort at Doune instead, but the rock may have been occupied by the Maeatae at this time.[3] It may later have been a stronghold of the Manaw Gododdin, and has also been identified with a settlement recorded in the 7th and 8th centuries as Iudeu, where King Penda of Mercia besieged King Oswy of Bernicia in 655.[3] The area came under Pictish control after the defeat of the Northumbrians at the Battle of Dun Nechtain thirty years later. However, there is no archaeological evidence for occupation of Castle Hill before the late medieval period.[4]\nOther legends have been associated with Stirling, or \"Snowdoun\" as it was more poetically known.[5] The 16th-century historian Hector Boece claims in his Historia Gentis Scotorum that the Romans, under Agricola, fortified Stirling,[6] and that Kenneth MacAlpin, traditionally the first King of Scotland, besieged a castle at Stirling during his takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the 9th century.[3] Boece is, however, considered an unreliable historian.[6]\nAnother chronicler, William Worcester, associated Stirling with the court of the legendary King Arthur. Tradition suggests that St Monenna founded a chapel here, as she is said to have done at Edinburgh Castle,[7] although it is now thought that the legend of Monenna results from a later confusion of early Christian figures, including Modwenna and Moninne.[8]\nThe first record of Stirling Castle dates from around 1110, when King Alexander I dedicated a chapel there.[9] It appears to have been an established royal centre by this time, as Alexander died here in 1124. During the reign of his successor David I, Stirling became a royal burgh, and the castle an important administration centre.[10] King William I formed a deer park to the south-west of the castle, but after his capture by the English in 1174, he was forced to surrender several castles, including Stirling and Edinburgh Castle, under the Treaty of Falaise. There is no evidence that the English actually occupied the castle, and it was formally handed back by Richard I of England in 1189. Stirling continued to be a favoured royal residence, with William himself dying there in 1214,[11] and Alexander III laying out the New Park, for deer hunting, in the 1260s.[12]\nWars of Independence\nStatue of Robert the Bruce on the castle esplanade\nStirling remained a centre of royal administration until the death of Alexander III in 1286. His passing triggered a succession crisis, with Edward I of England invited to arbitrate between competing claimants. Edward came north in 1291, demanding that Stirling, along with the other royal castles, be put under his control during the arbitration. Edward gave judgement in favour of John Balliol, hoping he would be a \"puppet\" ruler, but John refused to obey Edward's demands.[13]\nIn 1296, Edward invaded Scotland, beginning the Wars of Scottish Independence, which would last for the next 60 years. The English found Stirling Castle abandoned and empty, and set about occupying this key site.[14] They were dislodged the following year, after the victory of Andrew Moray and William Wallace at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. Many of the garrison were killed during the battle, after which the English commanders William FitzWarin and Marmaduke Thweng retreated into the castle. However, they were quickly starved into surrender by the Scots.[15]\nNext summer, the castle changed hands again, being abandoned by the Scots after the English victory at Falkirk. Edward strengthened the castle, but it was besieged in 1299 by forces including Robert Bruce. King Edward failed to relieve the garrison, who were forced to surrender.[14]\nBy 1303, the English again held the upper hand, and Stirling was the last remaining castle in Scottish hands. Edward's army arrived in April 1304, with at least 17 siege engines.[16] The Scots, under William Oliphant, surrendered on 20 July, but part of the garrison were ordered back into the castle by Edward, as he had not yet deployed his latest engine, \"Warwolf\". Warwolf is believed to have been a large trebuchet, which destroyed the castle's gatehouse.[17][16] Although Edward's victory seemed complete, he was dead by 1307, and Robert Bruce was now King of Scots. By 1313, only Stirling, Roxburgh, Edinburgh and Berwick castles were held by the English. Edward Bruce, the king's brother, laid siege to Stirling, which was held by Sir Philip Mowbray. After several months, on 24 June 1313, Mowbray proposed a bargain: that he would surrender the castle, if it were not relieved within one year by the English. Edward Bruce agreed, and withdrew.[18] Scottish historian Patrick Fraser Tytler would describe Mowbray's offer, five centuries later, as \"a truce involving conditions which ought on no account to have been accepted.\" As Tytler noted, the effect \"was to check the ardour of the Scots in that career of success, which was now rapidly leading to the complete deliverance of their country; it gave the King of England a whole year to assemble the strength of his dominions... We need not wonder, then, that Bruce was highly incensed, on hearing that, without consulting him, his brother had agreed to Mowbray's proposals.\"[19]\nThe following summer, the English duly headed north, led by Edward II, to save the castle.[18] On 23 June 1314, King Robert's forces met the English at the Battle of Bannockburn, within sight of the castle walls. The resulting English defeat was decisive. King Edward attempted to take refuge in the castle, but Mowbray was determined to keep to his word, and the English were forced to flee. Mowbray handed over the castle, changing sides himself in the process.[20] King Robert ordered the castle to be slighted; its defences destroyed to prevent reoccupation by the English.[18]\nMowbray refuses to let Edward II into the castle.\nThe war was not over, however. The second War of Scottish Independence saw the English in control of Stirling Castle by 1336, when Thomas Rokeby was the commander, and extensive works were carried out, still largely in timber rather than stone.[21] Andrew Murray attempted a siege in 1337, when guns may have been used for one of the first times in Scotland.[21] Robert Stewart, the future King Robert II, retook Stirling in a siege during 1341–1342. Maurice Murray was appointed as its keeper, who in the words of Andrew of Wyntoun \"inforsyt it grettumly, for riche he was and full mychty\" (enforced it greatly, for rich he was and full mighty).[22] In 1360, Robert de Forsyth was appointed governor of Stirling Castle, an office he passed on to his son John and grandson William, who was governor in 1399.[23]\nEarly Stewarts\nThe north gate of the castle, at the lower left, is probably the oldest part of the castle, dating partly from the 1380s.\nUnder the early Stewart kings Robert II (reigned 1371–1390) and Robert III (reigned 1390–1406), the earliest surviving parts of the castle were built. Robert Stewart, Earl of Menteith, Regent of Scotland as brother of Robert III, undertook works on the north and south gates. The present north gate is built on these foundations of the 1380s, the earliest surviving masonry in the castle.[24] In 1424, Stirling Castle was part of the jointure (marriage settlement) given to James I's wife Joan Beaufort, establishing a tradition which later monarchs continued.[25]\nAfter James' murder in 1437, Joan took shelter here with her son, the young James II. He hosted a tournament at Stirling on Shrove Tuesday 1449, which included a combat between two teams of three, led by the Burgundian knight Jacques de Lalaing and James Douglas, a brother of the Earl of Douglas. The Burgundian knights were the victors.[26] In 1452, it was at Stirling Castle that James stabbed and killed William, 8th Earl of Douglas, when the latter refused to end a potentially treasonous alliance with John of Islay, Earl of Ross and Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Crawford. James III (reigned 1460–1488) was born here, and later undertook works to the gardens and the chapel royal. The manufacture of artillery in the castle is recorded in 1475.[27] James' wife, Margaret of Denmark, died in Stirling Castle in 1486, and two years later James himself died at the Battle of Sauchieburn, fought over almost the same ground as the Battle of Bannockburn, just to the south of the castle.[28]\nRenaissance palace\nAlmost all the present buildings in the castle were constructed between 1490 and 1600, when Stirling was developed as a principal royal centre by the Stewart kings James IV, James V and James VI. The architecture of these new buildings shows an eclectic mix of English, French and German influences, reflecting the international ambitions of the Stewart dynasty.[29]\nJames V, builder of the Royal Palace, by Corneille de Lyon\nJames IV (reigned 1488–1513) kept a full Renaissance court, including alchemists, and sought to establish a palace of European standing at Stirling.[30] He undertook building works at the royal residences of Edinburgh, Falkland and Linlithgow, but the grandest works were at Stirling, and include the King's Old Building, the Great Hall, and the Forework.[31] He also renovated the chapel royal, one of two churches within the castle at this time, and in 1501 received approval from Pope Alexander VI for the establishment of a college of priests.[32] The Forework, of which little now remains, was derived from French military architecture, although military details were added more for style than for defence.[33] A new portcullis was painted with red lead and linseed oil.[34] The gardener, George Campbell, built archery butts next to the stables in 1504.[35] James IV played tennis at Stirling with the Spanish ambassador, Pedro de Ayala.[36]\nIf a satirical account in two poems by the poet William Dunbar is based on facts, the castle walls may have been the site of an attempt at human-powered flight, c.1509, by the Italian alchemist and abbot of Tongland, John Damian.[37] The Captain of the Castle Andrew Aytoun kept an alchemist called Caldwell maintaining a furnace for \"quinta essencia\", the mythical fifth element, at the castle.[38]\nThe building works begun by James IV had not been completed at the time of his death at the Battle of Flodden. His successor, James V (reigned 1513–1542), was crowned in the chapel royal, and grew up in the castle under the guardianship of Lord Erskine. In 1515, the Regent Albany brought 7,000 men to Stirling to wrest control of the young king from his mother, Margaret Tudor.[39] James V as monarch was said to have travelled in disguise under the name \"Gudeman of Ballengeich\", after the road running under the eastern wall of the castle. Ballengeich means \"windy pass\" in Gaelic.[40] In 1533 a priest James Nicholson was in charge of the building fabric, and he also fed cranes, herons, peacocks, and bitterns for the king's table.[41]\nJames V continued and expanded his father's building programme, creating the centrepiece of the castle, the Royal Palace, built under the direction of Sir James Hamilton of Finnart and masons brought from France.[42] James V also died young, leaving unfinished work to be completed by his widow, Mary of Guise. His infant daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots, was brought to Stirling Castle for safety, and crowned in the chapel royal on 9 September 1543. She too was brought up here, until she was sent to Inchmahome Priory, and then to France in 1548. In the 1550s, during the Regency of Mary of Guise, Anglo-French hostilities were fought out in Scotland. Artillery fortifications were added to the south approach of the castle including the 'French Spur', and these form the basis of the present Outer Defences.[43] Guise employed an Italian military engineer called Lorenzo Pomarelli.[44] From 1534 to 1584 Michael Gardiner was in charge of the artillery.[45]\nQueen Mary returned to Scotland in 1561, and visited Stirling Castle frequently. She nursed Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, through an illness here in 1565, and the two were soon married.[46] Their son, James VI, was baptised here in December 1566. The celebrations included fireworks, an assault on a mock castle, and a masque designed by Bastian Pagez.[47] Darnley was already estranged from the Queen and did not attend although he was resident at the castle.[48] James' guardian, the Earl of Mar, was made hereditary governor of the castle in 1566.[46] Mary was travelling from Stirling when she was abducted by the Earl of Bothwell, beginning the chain of events that led to her forced abdication and her flight to England.[49] When Mary escaped from Lochleven Castle in May 1568, the Earl of Mar was ordered step up security at Stirling around the king and expel from the castle all but his closest friends and relatives.[50]\nThe young King James was crowned in July 1567 in the nearby Church of the Holy Rude, and grew up within the castle walls in the care of Annabell Murray, Countess of Mar and under the tutelage of the humanist scholar George Buchanan. A tennis court was built of timber for the king in 1576.[51] Frequently used as a pawn in the struggles between his regents and the supporters of Mary, the young king was closely guarded. Stirling became the base for James' supporters, while those nobles who wished to see Queen Mary restored gathered at Edinburgh, under William Kirkcaldy of Grange. Grange led a raid on Stirling in 1571, attempting to round up the Queen's enemies, but failed to gain control of the castle or the King.[52]\nThe keeper of the Castle, Alexander Erskine of Gogar was ejected by supporters of Regent Morton in April 1578, after his son was fatally wounded during a struggle at the gate.[53] The rebellious Earls of Mar and Angus seized the castle in 1584, but surrendered and fled to England when the King arrived with an army. They returned the following year, forcing the King to surrender, although they proclaimed their loyalty to him.[54]\nIn December 1593 Anne of Denmark decided to come to Stirling for the birth of her first child, and James ordered the palace which was in \"ruin and decay\" to be repaired.[55] Prince Henry was born in the castle in 1594, and the present Chapel Royal was constructed for his baptism on 30 August. Probably built by William Schaw, the chapel completed the quadrangle of the Inner Close. Like his predecessors Henry spent his childhood here under the 2nd Earl of Mar, until the Union of the Crowns of 1603, when his father succeeded as King of England and the royal family left for London.[56]\nMilitary fortress\nAfter their departure, Stirling's role as a royal residence declined, and it became principally a military centre. It was used as a prison for persons of rank during the 17th century, and saw few visits by the monarch. The architect James Murray restored roofs and facilities of the castle for the return of James VI & I to Scotland, who stayed in Stirling during July 1617.[57] From 1625, extensive preparations were made for the anticipated visit of the new king, Charles I, including works to the gardens and painting of the Chapel Royal.[58] Charles did not come to Scotland until 1633, and only stayed in the castle briefly.[59]\nFollowing the execution of Charles I, the Scots crowned his son Charles II, and he became the last reigning monarch to stay here, living at the castle in 1650.[60] The Royalist forces were defeated at Dunbar by those of Oliver Cromwell, and the King marched south to defeat at Worcester. General Monck laid siege to the castle on 6 August 1651, erecting gun platforms in the adjacent churchyard. After the garrison mutinied, Colonel William Conyngham was obliged to surrender on 14 August.[61] Damage done during the siege can still be seen on the church and the Great Hall.[62]\nStirling Castle, drawn by John Slezer in 1693, and showing James IV's now-demolished Forework\nStirling Castle in 1900\nAfter The Restoration of Charles II, the Earl of Mar was restored as governor, and the castle was frequently used as a prison, housing several Covenanters.[62] James, Duke of Albany, later King James VII of Scotland and II of England, visited the castle in 1681. During this time, the castle's military role became increasingly important, a powder magazine being built in the castle gardens, and a formal garrison installed from 1685.[62] At the accession of King George I in 1714, John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar was deprived of the governorship, as well as the post of Scottish Secretary. In response, he raised the standard of James Stuart, the \"Old Pretender\", in the Jacobite rising of 1715. Government troops, under the Duke of Argyll, quickly moved to occupy the fortress, then advanced to Sheriffmuir to block Mar's way. The Battle of Sheriffmuir was inconclusive, but the rising was effectively over. The Jacobite rising of 1745 saw Charles Edward Stuart lead his army of Highlanders past Stirling on the way to Edinburgh. Following the Jacobites' retreat from England, they returned to Stirling in January 1746. The town soon surrendered, but the castle governor refused to capitulate. Artillery works were set up on Gowan Hill, but were quickly destroyed by the castle's guns. Despite victory at Falkirk, the Jacobites withdrew north on 1 February.[63]\nFrom 1800 the Castle was owned by the War Office and run as a barracks. Many alterations were made to the Great Hall, which became an accommodation block, to the Chapel Royal, which became a lecture theatre and dining hall, to the King's Old Building, which became an infirmary and to the Royal Palace, which became the Officer's Mess. A number of new buildings were also constructed, including the prison and powder magazine, at the Nether Bailey, in 1810. Queen Victoria visited in 1842, and the Prince of Wales in 1859.[64]\nIn 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the barracks became the depot for the 72nd (Highland) Regiment of Foot and the 91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot.[65] Following the Childers Reforms, the 91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot and the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot amalgamated to form the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders with its depot in the barracks in 1881.[66]\nTwentieth century\nReplica of one of The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries in the Queen's Presence ChamberThe restored fireplace in the King's ChamberReplica of a bedroom\nThe Royal Lodgings have now been returned to something approaching their former glory. A major programme of research and re-presentation, lasting ten years and costing £12 million, was completed in summer 2011. Since January 2002, the Tapestry Studio at West Dean College near Chichester in West Sussex has been working on a recreation of The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries, four of which are now hanging in the restored Queen's Presence Chamber in the Royal Palace. Historians studying the reign of James V believe that a similar series of Unicorn tapestries were part of the royal collection.[67]\nThe team of weavers visited The Cloisters, part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, to inspect the 15th-century originals, and researched medieval weaving techniques, colour palettes and materials. The weavers worked both at the college in West Sussex, and at a studio at Stirling Castle. The project was completed in 2015.[68]\nStirling Castle remains the headquarters of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, although Balaclava Company, the sole surviving unit of the regiment, has been garrisoned at Redford Barracks in Edinburgh since 2014.[69] The regimental museum is also located within the castle.[70]\nInterior\nOuter defences Aerial view of the interior castle\nThe French Spur, part of the outer defences, looking eastwardCannons\nThe Outer Defences comprise artillery fortifications, and were built in their present form in the 18th century, although some parts, including the French Spur at the east end, date back to the regency of Mary of Guise in the 1550s.[71] The French Spur was originally an ear-shaped bastion known as an orillon, and contained gun emplacements which protected the main spur. This projecting spur was fronted by an earth ramp called a talus, and was entered via a drawbridge over a ditch. Excavations in the 1970s showed that much of the original stonework remains within the 18th-century defences.[71]\nFollowing the attempted Jacobite invasion of 1708, improvements to the castle's defences were ordered as a matter of priority. A scheme of new defences was proposed by Theodore Dury, although this was criticised by one Captain Obryan, who put forward his own, much more expensive, scheme. In the end a compromise was built, and was complete by 1714.[72] The main front wall was extended outwards, to form Guardhouse Square. This had the effect of creating two defensive walls, both of which were fronted by ditches defended by covered firing galleries known as caponiers.[73] One of the caponiers survives and is accessible from Guardhouse Square by a narrow staircase.[74]\nTo the rear of the walls, chambers called casemates were built to strengthen the wall, and to provide gun emplacements. The French Spur was modified slightly to allow more cannons to be mounted.[72] The buildings within Guardhouse Square date from the 19th century.[75] Outside the castle is the early 19th-century Esplanade, used as a parade ground, and now as a car park and performance space.[74]\nForework\nThe Forework, entry to the main part of the castle\nThe gatehouse providing entry from the outer defences to the castle proper was erected by King James IV, and was probably completed around 1506.[76] It originally formed part of a Forework, extending as a curtain wall across the whole width of Castle Hill. At the centre is the gatehouse itself, which now stands to less than half its original height. The round towers at the outer corners rose to conical roofs, with battlements carried around the tops of the towers. These were flanked by more round towers, of which only traces now remain, and mirrored by further rounds at the rear of the gatehouse. The overall design, as drawn by John Slezer in 1693, shows French influence, and has parallels with the forework erected at Linlithgow Palace.[77]\nLike the Linlithgow structure, the Forework was probably intended more for show, evoking the \"age of chivalry\", than for defence, as it would have offered little protection against contemporary artillery.[76] The entrance was via a central passage, flanked by two separate pedestrian passages. This triple arrangement was unusual in its time, and Classical triumphal arches have been suggested as an influence.[76] The gatehouse was dismantled gradually, and was consolidated in its present form in 1810. At each end of the crenellated curtain wall was a rectangular tower. The west tower, known as the Prince's Tower, probably after Henry, Prince of Scotland, survives to its full height, and is now attached to the later palace. At the east end, the Elphinstone Tower contained a kitchen and possibly an officer's lodging.[76] It was cut down to form a gun battery, probably in the early 18th century when the Outer Defences were rebuilt.[72]\nOuter Close\nWithin the Forework is a courtyard known as the Outer Close. To the south-east are Georgian military buildings; the late 18th-century Main Guard House, and the early 19th-century Fort Major's House.[78] The early North Gate, giving access to the Nether Bailey, contained the original castle kitchens, which were probably linked to the Great Hall. The Great Kitchen which is now visible was constructed later, against the east wall of the castle. However, in 1689 these rooms were infilled with rubble to reinforce gun emplacements, known as the Grand Battery, which were built on top of the kitchen's vaults. Excavations in the 1920s ascertained the extent of the surviving rooms, and the vaults were reconstructed in 1929.[79] The small building above the North Gate is traditionally said to have been a mint, known in Scots as the Cunzie Hoose or \"coining house\". To the west of the Outer Close, the main parts of the castle are arranged around the quadrangular Inner Close: the Royal Palace to the south, the King's Old Building on the west, the Chapel Royal to the north, and the Great Hall to the east.[80]\nKing's Old Building\nThe arms of the Earl of Douglas stained glass in the King's Old Building\nThe oldest part of the Inner Close is the King's Old Building, located on the western side and completed around 1497.[81] It was begun as a new residential range by James IV, and originally comprised an L-shaped building. The principal rooms were on the first floor, over cellars, and included two chambers with wide open views to the west, although the interiors have been much altered.[82] The projecting stair tower has an octagonal upper section, which was copied for a second, later stair tower on the same building.[83]\nIn 1855, the north end of the building burned down, and was rebuilt in a Baronial style by the architect and historian Robert William Billings.[84] At the southwest end of the range is a linking building, once used as kitchens, which is on a different alignment to both the King's Old Building and the adjacent Royal Palace. It has been suggested that this is an earlier 15th-century structure, dating from the reign of James I.[25] Excavations within this building in 1998 revealed burials, suggesting that this may have been the site of a church or chapel.[81]\nGreat Hall\nThe Great Hall following restorationThe interior of the Great Hall facing north\nOn the east side of the Inner Close is the Great Hall, or Parliament Hall. This was built by James IV following on from the completion of the King's Old Building in 1497, and was being plastered by 1503.[85] Described as \"the grandest secular building erected in Scotland in the late Middle Ages\",[86] it represents the first example of Renaissance-influenced royal architecture in that country.[87]\nIt was worked on by a number of English craftsmen, and incorporates some English design ideas,[85] being comparable to Edward IV's hall at Eltham Palace in Kent, built in the late 1470s.[88] It includes Renaissance details, such as the intersecting tracery on the windows, within a conventional medieval plan.[87] Inside are five fireplaces, and large side windows lighting the dais end, where the king would be seated. It is 42 by 14.25 m (137.8 by 46.8 ft) across.[85]\nThe original hammerbeam roof was removed in 1800, along with the decorative crenellated parapet, when the hall was subdivided to form barracks. Two floors and five cross-walls were inserted, and the windows were altered accordingly.[89] As early as 1893, calls were being made for the restoration of the Great Hall,[90] but it was not until the army left in 1965 that the opportunity arose. It was agreed that a historically correct restoration could be achieved,[91] and works began which were only completed in 1999. The hammerbeam roof and parapet were replaced, windows reinstated, and the outer walls were limewashed.[92]\nRoyal Palace\nEast façade of the Royal Palace with Renaissance-period statues\nThe Royal Palace and the Queen Anne walled garden\nTo the left of the gatehouse, and forming the south side of the Inner Close, is the Royal Palace. The first Renaissance palace in the British Isles,[93] this was the work of King James V. With its combination of Renaissance architecture, and exuberant late-gothic detail, it is one of the most architecturally impressive buildings in Scotland, covered with unique carved stonework. It was begun in the 1530s, and was largely complete by the late 1540s.[94]\nThe Master of Works, until his execution in 1540, was Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, who also financed part of the work, in return for land and favours from the king.[95] Further work was carried out during the regency of Mary of Guise, and the upper floor was converted to provide an apartment for the castle governor in the 18th century.[96]\nThe architecture is French-inspired, but the decoration is German in inspiration,[33] and sources for the statues have been found in the work of the German engraver Hans Burgkmair.[97] The statues include a line of soldiers on the south parapet, and a series of full-size figures around the principal floor. These principal figures include a portrait of James V, the Devil, St Michael, and representations of Venus and several planetary deities. Their arrangement on the north, east and south faces of the Palace has been interpreted in relation to the quarters of the heavens.[98]\nThe 19th-century architectural historian R. W. Billings described the statues as \"the fruits of an imagination luxuriant but revolting\".[99] The west façade is undecorated and incomplete, and the Privy Council of Scotland noted in 1625 that the building was \"schote over the craig\".[100]\nInternally, the Palace comprises two apartments, one each for the king and queen. Each has a hall, presence chamber, and bedchamber, with various small rooms known as closets. The Renaissance decoration continued inside, although little has survived the building's military use, excepting the carved stone fireplaces. The ceiling of the King's Presence Chamber was originally decorated with a series of carved oak portrait roundels known as the Stirling Heads, described as \"among the finest examples of Scottish Renaissance wood-carving now extant\".[101] Some of the heads may have been made by a French-born carver Andrew Mansioun.[102] The carvings were taken down following a ceiling collapse in 1777, and of an estimated 56 original heads, 38 survive. Most were given to the Smith Institute in Stirling but now these are preserved in the castle, and three more are in the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh.[103] Another two are on display in the Thieves Pot, a preserved 16th-century jail within the Thistles Shopping Centre.[104]\nSome of the portraits are believed to be of kings, queens or courtiers, and others are thought to show classical or Biblical figures.[105] As with the exterior carving, similarities to German sources have been noted, and in particular to a ceiling in Wawel, Poland.[106] A £12 million project to recreate the grandeur of the Royal Palace reopened to the public during the weekend of 5 and 6 June 2011.[107][108] The restoration of the palace and its interiors involved a decade of research and craftsmanship, and restored six royal apartments to how they would have looked in the 1540s, when this was the childhood home of Mary Queen of Scots,[109] The project involved the recreation of seven hand-woven tapestries.[107][108]\nStirling heads\nStirling headsAll 37 heads of the restored ceiling of the King's ChamberHenry VIIIMary of GuiseA Roman EmperorPutto\nAn original Stirling Head, James V\nChapel Royal\nThe Chapel RoyalThe interior of Chapel Royal\nThe collegiate chapel established by James IV in 1501 lay between the King's Old Building and the Great Hall, but was further south than the present building. This was the chapel in which Queen Mary was crowned in 1543. However, when James VI's first son, Prince Henry was born in 1594, it was decided to rebuild the chapel as a suitable venue for the royal baptism.[110][111]\nThe new building was erected within a year, north of the old site to improve access to the hall.[112] There was some doubt if the chapel, which John Colville called the \"great temple of Solomon\",[113] could be finished in time.[114] The chapel, with its Italianate arched windows, was the work of the Royal Master of Works William Schaw.[115] The interior was decorated by the painter Valentine Jenkin prior to the visit of Charles I in 1633. The chapel too was later modified for military use, housing a dining room. The wall paintings were rediscovered in the 1930s, and restoration began after the Second World War.[116]\nNether Bailey\nBeyond the North Gate, the Nether Bailey occupies the northern end of Castle Hill. Surrounded by defensive walls, the area contains a 19th-century guard house and gunpowder stores, and the modern tapestry studio. There was formerly access to the Nether Bailey from Ballengeich to the west, until the postern was blocked in response to the threat of Jacobite rebellion.[117]\nGardens\nThere are two gardens within the castle, the southern one including a bowling green. Below the castle's west wall is the King's Knot, a 16th-century formal garden, now only visible as earthworks, but once including hedges and knot-patterned parterres.[58] The surviving octagonal earthwork mount was the work of the gardener William Watts and architect James Murray in 1629.[118] The gardens were built on the site of a medieval jousting arena known as the Round Table, in imitation of the legendary court of King Arthur.[119]\nModern use\nStirling Castle in 2017\nThe castle esplanade, or parade ground, has been used as an open-air concert venue for several noted acts, some of whom have used Stirling Castle and the surrounding scenery to film \"in concert\" DVDs. These acts include R.E.M., Ocean Colour Scene, Bob Dylan, Wet Wet Wet, Rod Stewart and Runrig. The esplanade also hosts the city's Hogmanay celebrations. The Regimental Museum and Home Headquarters of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders are located in the King's Old Building.[120] The museum closed for refurbishment on 31 August 2018 and reopened in June 2021.[121][122]\nCastle gardens in front of the Prince's Tower\nThe castle is open to the public year-round.[123] Stirling Castle is a popular place for tourists, and according to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, 609,698 people visited in 2019.[124]\nAn illustration of Stirling Castle features on the reverse side of a current series of £20 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank, with Robert the Bruce on horseback in the foreground.[125]\nDue to its similar appearance to Colditz Castle in Saxony, Germany, the castle was used to film the exterior shots for the 1970s TV series Colditz, a drama about the many attempts of Allied POWs to escape from the castle during its use as a military prison in the Second World War.[126]\nGhostlore\nNumerous accounts of ghostlore exist in relation to Stirling Castle, with the Green Lady being perhaps the most renowned. According to various reports, she has been sighted by a multitude of residents and visitors over the years.[127][128][129] One widely circulated narrative posits that the Green Lady was a maidservant who rescued Queen Mary from a perilous situation. Many interpret the apparition of the Green Lady as a portent of impending danger, often in the form of a fire.[130]\nSee also\nGovernor of Stirling Castle\nBanknotes of Scotland (featured on design)\nCastles in Great Britain and Ireland\nList of castles in Scotland\nReferences\nBibliography\nAnonymous (1817).

    "text": "Historic location in Dumbarton, Scotland\nFor warships of this name, see HMS Dumbarton Castle. For The Kingdom of Alt Clut, see Kingdom of Strathclyde.\nDumbarton Castle (Scottish Gaelic: Dùn Breatainn, pronounced [t̪unˈpɾʲɛʰt̪ɪɲ]; Welsh: Alt Clut) has the longest recorded history of any stronghold in Scotland. It sits on a volcanic plug of basalt known as Dumbarton Rock which is 240 feet (73 m) high and overlooks the Scottish town of Dumbarton.\nHistory\nDumbarton Rock was formed between 330 and 340 million years ago, during the Early Carboniferous period, a time of widespread volcanic activity in the area where Glasgow is now situated; over time, the softer exterior of the volcano weathered away, leaving behind a volcanic plug of basalt.[3]\nIron Age\nAt least as far back as the Iron Age, this has been the site of a strategically important settlement, as evidenced by archaeological finds.\nThe people that came to reside there in the era of Roman Britain were known to have traded with the Romans. However the first written record about a settlement there was in a letter that Saint Patrick wrote to King Ceretic of Alt Clut in the late 5th century.\nEarly Medieval era\nDavid Nash Ford has proposed that Dumbarton was the Cair Brithon ('Fort of the Britons') listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Sub-Roman Britain.[4] From the 5th century until the 9th, the castle was the centre of the independent Brythonic Kingdom of Strathclyde. Alt Clut or Alcluith (Scottish Gaelic: Alt Chluaidh, pronounced [aɫ̪d̪̊ˈxɫ̪uəj], lit. 'Rock of the Clyde'), the Brythonic name for Dumbarton Rock, became a metonym for the kingdom. The king of Dumbarton in about AD 570 was Riderch Hael, who features in Welsh and Latin works.[5]\nMerlin was said to have stayed at Alt Clut. The medieval Scalacronica of Sir Thomas Grey recorded the legend that says that \"Arthur left Hoël of Brittany his nephew sick at Alcluit in Scotland.\"[6] Hoël made a full recovery, but was besieged in the castle by the Scots and Picts. The story first appeared in Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae.[7] Amongst lists of three things, in the triads of the Red Book of Hergest, the third \"Unrestrained Ravaging\" was Aeddan Fradog (the Wily, perhaps Áedán mac Gabráin), coming to the court of Rhydderch the Generous at Alclud, who left neither food nor drink nor beast alive. This battle also appears in stories of Myrddin Wyllt, the Merlin of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Vita Merlini, perhaps conflated with the battle of Arfderydd, located as Arthuret by some authors.[8]\nIn 756, the first (and second) losses of Dumbarton Rock were recorded. A joint force of Picts and Northumbrians captured the fortress after a siege, only to lose it again a few days later. By 870, it was home to a tightly packed British settlement, which served as a fortress and as the capital of Alt Clut. In 871, the Irish-based Viking kings Amlaíb Conung and Ímar laid siege to Dumbarton Rock. The fortress fell in four months, after its water supply failed. The kings are recorded to have returned to Ireland with 200 ships and a host of British, English, and Pictish captives. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king Arthgal ap Dyfnwal, who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances. Following the Viking destruction of the fortress, Dumbarton Rock does not appear on record again until the 13th century, and the capital of the restructured Kingdom of Strathclyde appears to have relocated up the Clyde to the vicinity of Partick and Govan.\nMedieval era\nDumbarton castle in 1800[9]\nIn medieval Scotland, Dumbarton (Dùn Breatainn, which means \"the fortress of the Britons\") was an important royal castle. It is believed to be the place Sir John Menteith took William Wallace on the way to London after Wallace's capture.\nThe Governor of the castle in 1333, Malcolm Fleming of Fulwood, had earlier served as tutor to the young David II. He sheltered the king and his young wife, Joan of The Tower after the Scottish defeat at Halidon Hill on 19 July. He later safely conveyed the royal couple to greater safety in France, attended by his daughter Evota Fleming, as Maid of Honour. The king and queen remained in France for eight years, but Malcolm Fleming returned to Dumbarton and continued to hold it safely against an English siege.[10] In doing so he also protected the 17-year-old Robert the Steward (later King Robert II). For these services David II created Fleming the First Earl of Wigtown (the first new Scottish earldom created in more than a century).[11]\nWigtown was still Governor in 1361 when the Black Death again swept into Scotland and a third of the castle's garrison died.[12] Following his own death a year later he was succeeded as Sheriff of Dunbartonshire and Governor of Dumbarton Castle by his nephew, Malcolm Fleming of Biggar.\nIn 1425 the castle was attacked by James the Fat, youngest son of Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, who had been imprisoned by King James I of Scotland on charges of treason. James the Fat became a rallying point for enemies of the King, and raised a rebellion against the crown. He marched on the town of Dumbarton and burned it, but was unable to take the castle, whose defender Sir John Colquhoun successfully held out against James' men.[13][14] He was rewarded by the king, James I of Scotland, with the governorship of the royal castle, which he held until his death in 1439.\nJames IV and Dumbarton\nThe former supporters of James III under the leadership of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox met up at Dumbarton Castle in October 1489. They had hoped to gain the support of Henry VII of England. James IV defeated them in a battle between the Touch and Menteith hills near Stirling on 11 and 12 October.[15] James IV used Dumbarton as the west coast base for his navy and campaigns to subdue the Western Isles. James was at Dumbarton with the Chancellor of Scotland, Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, in November 1489. He had the use of a ship belonging to the Laird of Luss. In the following February a royal ship was 'chaysit' by the English and lost some of her cables. In 1494 a row barge was built at Dumbarton for the king using timber from Loch Lomond.\nIn March 1495 James IV was provided with a camp bed for use at sea and a boat carried cannon to Dumbarton. Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell, was made Captain of the castle on 1 April 1495. A man played on the clarschaw, a Gaelic harp, for the King. In 1503, on the day after his wedding to Margaret Tudor, James gave the castle to his new queen.[16] In 1505 Dumbarton was the King's base for visiting the Western Isles. One ship's mast was made from timber from Drymen. On 5 June James was entertained by a French \"quhissilar\" (whistler), perhaps playing a recorder and on 8 June James played cards with John Murray and Master Robert Cockburn losing £4 and 10 shillings, and later that day attended Evensong in the Parish kirk and College of Dumbarton. In 1505 John Ramsay built a ship for the King called the Columb (Saint Columba being the father of Christianity in Scotland). In December 1505 a sword that had belonged to William Wallace was repaired.[17]\nRegent Albany, James V and the circumnavigation of Scotland\nOn 18 May 1515 the James or the Margaret with six other ships brought John Stewart, Regent Albany to Dumbarton. These royal ships were repaired at Dumbarton in July and new docks were made for them. John Drummond of Milnab brought fourteen of their guns to Glasgow.[18] In September Regent Albany held court at Dumbarton, and received Thomas Benolt, the English Clarenceux King of Arms. The Carrick Herald and Clarenceux were sent to Lord Maxwell.[19] In March 1516 Albany issued six letters of remission (forgiveness) to those who had held the castle for Lennox against the king in 1489.[20] Regent Albany returned to France from Dumbarton in 1524.[21]\nIn 1526 John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox fortified Dumbarton against the Douglas faction who had control of the young James V, but his forces were defeated by Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus at the battle of Linlithgow Bridge. James Hamilton of Finnart, who was implicated in the death of the Earl of Lennox, was given custody of the castle till 1531.[22] Later in his personal reign James V used the castle as a prison for those convicted at the justice ayre, receiving their fines and composition payments in 1539.[23] In 1540 James circumnavigated Scotland from the Forth and arrived at Dumbarton with Cardinal Beaton, the Earl of Huntly, and the Earl of Arran each leading a force of five hundred men. This expedition was later published by Nicolas de Nicolay Seigneur d'Arfeville, cosmographer to the King of France in 1583, with the first modern map of Scotland's coastline.[24]\nLennox and Mary, Queen of Scots\nMatthew, Earl of Lennox had been an ally of the French party in Scotland led by Mary of Guise but committed himself to the pro-English faction. In 1544 munitions and ten thousand French crowns of the sun arrived with Jacques de la Brosse at Dumbarton's harbour and were secured by Lennox and the Earl of Glencairn. Lennox then went into England, leaving the castle in the keeping of William Stirling of Glorat. Lennox signed a deal with Henry VIII of England offering Dumbarton Castle and the Isle of Bute in return for land in England and marriage to Henry's niece Margaret Douglas, and the future Governorship of Scotland if circumstances permitted. Lennox undertook to prevent the infant queen Mary being taken from Scotland. However, George Stirling of Glorat, unhappy at this policy, prevented Lennox returning into the castle and he was forced to sail to Ireland. George Stirling declared that he would hold the castle in the name of the young queen only. The Privy Council of Scotland agreed to George Stirling's plan. Despite this, more French troops landed at Dumbarton under the leadership of Lorges Montgomery, the soldier who later killed Henry II of France at a joust in 1559.[25]\nIn May 1545 Lennox tried to take the castle, with soldiers commanded by his brother, Robert Stewart, Bishop of Caithness. He sailed from Chester with around 20 followers in May 1546 in the Katherine Goodman and a pinnace.[26] Regent Arran besieged the castle with a superior force, having borrowed the artillery of the Earl of Argyle and ordering Robert Hamilton of Briggis to bring guns from Dunbar.[27] George Stirling of Glorat surrendered after 20 days and made terms. The chronicle historian John Lesley wrote that the Captain and the Bishop surrendered the castle to Arran and were rewarded, after negotiation by the Earl of Huntly.[28] The siege at Dumbarton delayed Arran's action at the siege of St Andrews Castle on the East coast of Scotland.[29]\nThereafter the castle was in the hands of Regent Arran and he held court in person there in July giving legal remission to the keeper of the Castle and in March 1547 acknowledging the good service of George Stirling of Glorat in rendering the castle to him.[30]\nAs the war of the Rough Wooing continued, Mary, Queen of Scots was lodged in the castle by 22 February 1548. Alexander Cunningham, 5th Earl of Glencairn wrote to Mary of Guise from Dumbarton that he had received a French cargo, and it would be as safe as if it were in Stirling Castle.[31] The English commander Grey of Wilton proposed basing warships at Lamlash on Arran as a convenient base to watch for French ships coming for Mary.[32]\nMary of Guise was at the castle in the first days of May 1548 and Mary, Queen of Scots was kept at the castle for several months before her embarkation for France for safety on 13 July 1548. The Castle Governor at this time was James Fleming, 4th Lord Fleming who accompanied the queen's party to France. The sailing however was delayed by adverse winds till 7 August 1548. Her party including her governess Lady Fleming and the Four Marys left the Clyde in a fleet under the command of Nicolas de Villegagnon and Michel de Seure.[33] They sailed around the west coast of Ireland, to avoid English ships commanded by Edward Clinton. In France she was soon betrothed to the young dauphin Francis.[34]\nRegent Arran made Andrew Hamilton captain and keeper of Dumbarton. In 1557, there was war between England and Scotland again. According to a rumour heard by Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis, five hundred Gascon soldiers arrived at Dumbarton destined to serve on the borders against the English for Mary of Guise.[35]\nMarian Civil War, Regent Morton, and the Dukes of Lennox\nMary, Queen of Scots stayed at Dumbarton Castle in July 1563.[36] After the defeat at the Battle of Langside in 1568 she tried to reach the Castle, but went instead to England. John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming, keeper of the Castle went with her into England and was allowed to return. When William Kirkcaldy of Grange governor of Edinburgh Castle changed sides to support Mary, this became a problem for Regent Moray. The subsequent conflict is known as the Marian Civil War.\nThe first siege of Dumbarton was lifted because of the assassination of Regent Moray in January 1570. The assassin James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh was welcomed at Dumbarton. Fleming's defence of Dumbarton for Mary was staunch, assisted by the timely arrival of supply ships from France under the command of his cousin, Thomas Fleming. Lord Fleming's attempt to ambush the English general William Drury in May 1570 failed and was satirized in a ballad printed by Robert Lekprevik in May that year and attributed to Robert Sempill; The tressoun of Dumbertane.[37][38] In October 1570 during the Marian civil war Fleming fortified the castle for Mary against the supporters of James VI of Scotland with stones obtained by demolishing churches and houses in Dumbarton and Cardross.[39] The castle was captured by the forces of Regent Lennox led by Thomas Crawford of Jordanhill and John Cunningham of Drumquhassle in the early hours of 2 April 1571, who used ladders to scale the rock and surprise the garrison.[40] Lord Fleming escaped by sea but died a year later when accidentally wounded by friendly fire as he supervised the supply of additional munitions at Edinburgh Castle.\nDumbarton Castle was used as prison for Regent Morton in June 1581 before his execution in Edinburgh. On 8 September 1582 the castle was put unto the keeping of William Stewart of Caverston an ally of Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, the King's favourite. The Duke of Lennox was displaced by the Gowrie Regime and went to the castle in secret pretending to be travelling from Edinburgh to nearby Dalkeith Palace. Lennox had his own ship there described as a barque. Robert Bowes, the English resident agent, expected the Duke of Lennox would sail to France from Dumbarton \"having well victualled his shippe there.\" Other observers were anxious that the castle might become a foothold for French forces in Scotland allied to Lennox and his faction. In December 1582 two Englishmen in Lennox's service at Dumbarton left by his ship from Largs. Lennox himself travelled to France through England, never to return.[41]\nJames VI made John Hamilton, 1st Marquis of Hamilton, captain of Dunbarton Castle in 1595, an office he was obliged to relinquish to the king's cousin and favourite Ludovic Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox, in January 1598.[42] The king later visited Dunbarton during his progress and ate dinner at the castle on 24 August 1598.[43] By 1620, Sir John Stewart, an illegitimate son of the 2nd Duke of Lennox, had been made constable and keeper of Dumbarton Castle.[42]\nSeventeenth century\nAlthough few buildings remain from this period there are records of works in 1617, 1618, and 1628–9. A replacement Wallace Tower was built superseding the medieval building. In June 1618 masons were working on the upper storey and it was decided to make the tower larger. Externally it was finished with lime plaster called harling. At the south side there was a bell house. By 1627 it was discovered that the keeper Sir John Stewart of Methven had neglected the fortress. He was replaced by Sir John Stewart of Traquair who recorded the poor state of the building. Surviving accounts mostly record work on the artillery and the 'foir yet wall' a defence on the southern side. The Scottish Parliament in 1644 judged that the castle was likely to be more hurtful than useful to the country.[44]\nIn November 1645 the Committee of Estates approved the recruitment of thirty extra soldiers by the keeper John Semple to guard the increased number of prisoners.[45] The castle's strategic importance declined after Oliver Cromwell's death in 1658. However, due to threats posed by Jacobites and the French in the eighteenth century, new structures and defences were built and the castle was garrisoned until World War II. Some documentation for these later works is preserved in the National Archives of Scotland.\nInventories\nSeveral lists of the castle's contents survive, including inventories from 1510, 1571, 1580, 1644, and 1668. These list guns and furniture and name many locations in the castle.[46] There is also a list of cannon transported by John Drummond of Milnab to Dumbarton in 1536.[47] In 1510 St Patricks chapel contained an old parchment mass book, a pewter chalice, and liturgical cloths. The hall had four tables and next to that was a chalmer of Dess, a 'solar' in English terms with a bed. The Wallace tower was protected with an iron yett and draw bar, there were bedchambers within and a bell at the head of the tower; the 'Wynde Hall' contained another bed.[48]\nIn August 1536 George Stirling of Glorat took delivery from John Drummond the king's Master Wright of four great guns and six falcons on carriages with wheels, thirty three bronze hagbut hand-guns and four iron culverins, with ammunition and powder and ramrods for the big guns. John Drummond took away an old brass gun that was 10 feet (3 metres) long.[47]\nIn 1571 amongst the cannon and guns there was a \"gross culverin\", two small \"batteris\", and a French \"moyen\" mounted for use on the walls. Another moyen was suitable for action in the field. There were two Brittany-made falcons on the walls, a quarter falcon and a \"double barse\". Provisions included eleven hogshead of biscuit. Some of the guns were subsequently taken to besiege Edinburgh Castle during the Marian civil war.[49]\nThe document compiled in 1580 was \"the inventar of the munitioun and uther insicht geir underwrittin left in the castell of Dumbertane be Johnne Conninghame of Drumquhassill and deliverit be the said Johnne to William Stewart of Cabirston in name and behalf of ane noble and potent lord Esme erll of Lennox lord Darnley and Obeigny on the 27 August 1580\". There were six large cannon. The bed in the chamber of dais was now described as \"ane stand bed of eistland tymmar with ruf and pannell of the same\", a bed made from imported Baltic oak.[50]\nBy 1644, when John Sempill was made keeper the 'Chamber of deisse' still contained a bed with a chamber pot and truckle bed for a servant, but it also contained armaments. There were twelve ram-rods, and three worms' - screws for unloading guns, three hagbuts and an iron flail. The hall contained twelve broken pikes, four without their iron blades. The contents of the armoury included thirty-three corslets, 105 helmets, and 43 swords.[51]\nIn 1668 the Governor Francis Montgomerie of Giffin recorded that the first floor of a lodging called the 'new chamber' contained 'a quantity of old rusty guns and sword, so rusted broke and spoiled that they can never serve for any use, above the beds were 'insufficient' and in the top room there was spoiled matches. The windows of this new lodging were broken. Montgomerie was worried about the water-supply from the loch and the 'laigh' low well.[52]\nGovernors and Keepers\nGovernors\nDumbarton Castle, 1836 engraving by William Miller after J. M. W.

Not much survives from the medieval castle: the 14th-century Portcullis Arch, the foundations of the Wallace Tower, and what may be the foundations of the White Tower. There is a 16th-century guard house, which includes a face which according to legend is \"Fause Menteith\", who betrayed William Wallace.[85]\nMost of the existing structures were built in the 18th century, including the Governor's House, built for John Kennedy, 8th Earl of Cassilis, and fortifications which demonstrate the struggle by military engineers to adapt an intractable site to contemporary defensive needs. The castle is open on a daily basis during the summer season and Saturday-Wednesday in the winter. There are 557 steps to the summit of the White Tower Crag, which has a good view of the area.[86]\nDumbarton Rock is in state ownership and is legally protected by the Scottish Government as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.[87]\nGeodesy\nUp to 1919 Dumbarton Rock was the origin (meridian) of the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps for Dumbartonshire.

    "wikiPage": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloch_Castle",
    "text": "Historic site in Scotland\nThis article is about the castle in West Dunbartonshire. For castles also known by this name, see Loch Doon Castle and Taymouth Castle.\nBalloch Castle is an early 19th-century country house situated at the southern tip of Loch Lomond, in West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. Balloch was a property of the Lennox family from the 11th century, and the old castle was built in the 13th century. In the 19th century the estate was purchased by John Buchanan of Ardoch, who demolished the ruins of the old castle and erected the present building. The Tudor Gothic architecture is the work of Robert Lugar. In 1915 Balloch was bought by Glasgow City Corporation, and has been leased by West Dunbartonshire Council since 1975. The estate was designated as a country park in 1980, and since 2002 has been part of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. Although the house has been periodically used for visitor facilities and council offices, it is now included on the Buildings at Risk Register. Balloch Castle is a category A listed building, and the estate is included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.\nHistory\nThe old castle\nThe lands of Balloch were granted to the Lennox family in 1072 by King Malcolm III,[1] forming part of the ancient earldom of Lennox. The earls of Lennox built the original Balloch Castle around 1238, and held it until approximately 1390.[1] Many of their early charters were dated at Balloch.[2] The earls afterwards moved their base to the island of Inchmurrin in Loch Lomond, where the remains of a late 14th-century castle can still be seen.[3] Situated nearer the water than the present day castle, there are no standing remains, the earthworks can still be seen. An irregular mound, approximately 50 by 45 metres (164 by 148 ft), surrounded by a ditch up to 5 metres (16 ft) across.[2] This site is given statutory protection as a scheduled monument.[4]\nIn the 15th century Balloch, along with the earldom of Lennox, came to the Stewarts of Darnley. It stayed in the Stewart family until 1652 when the 4th Duke of Lennox sold it to John Colquhoun of Luss.[5]\nBalloch Castle\nThe garden front of Balloch, seen across the parkland\nThe present castle was built as a residence in 1808–1809 at the order of John Buchanan of Ardoch (1761–1839), who had bought the estate in 1800.[5] Buchanan was a Glasgow merchant, the son of Thomas Buchanan of Ardoch (died 1789). John Buchanan was involved in his father's hat-making business, and also like his father was a partner in the Ship Bank, Glasgow's oldest banking house, founded in 1749. He represented Dunbartonshire in parliament from 1821 to 1826.[6][7][8]\nThe architect of the Tudor Gothic building was London-based Robert Lugar, who had designed the nearby Tullichewan Castle in 1792.[9] The building's turrets and crenellations are purely decorative with no defensive value. The lancet windows, tracery, hoodmoulds and blind arrow-slits are all borrowings from earlier building styles. Although an unimaginative designer, at Balloch Lugar helped to introduce the asymmetrical, \"picturesque\" form of castellated house into Scotland.[10] The new castle may incorporate stone from the earlier castle,[1] or the fabric of an earlier building on the site.[11] Buchanan established the parkland around the castle, including the planting of ornamental trees and imported shrubs.[5]\nOrnamental crenellations and blind arrow-slits\nLater history\nIn 1830, Buchanan purchased the adjacent estate of Boturich, including a ruined castle 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Balloch Castle. He again engaged Robert Lugar to rebuild the castle, which he then occupied, selling Balloch.[12] The latter passed through several owners in the 19th century, including Mr Gibson Stott, who made further improvements to the parks, and the Denniston-Brown family.[1] The estate, comprising 815 acres (330 ha), was purchased in 1915 by the Corporation of the City of Glasgow, the predecessor of the current city council, to provide publicly accessible open space. Although still owned by Glasgow City Council, the park and house have been leased to Dunbarton District Council, and its successor West Dunbartonshire Council, since 1975. It was registered as a country park in 1980.[5] The house has been a category A listed building since 1971.[11]\nThe house has periodically been used to provide visitor facilities and offices, with past occupants including the Nature Conservancy Council and the local Countryside Ranger Service.[5] By 2008 the building was in poor condition, and was added to the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland. In January 2014, an application for listed building consent was lodged, to permit repairs to the now-disused structure.[13] In February 2014 West Dunbartonshire Council announced a programme of repairs to preserve the building.[14]\nEstate\nWalled garden within the grounds\nFurther information: Balloch Country Park\nThe castle grounds feature two main pleasure gardens, one to the north of the house including rhododendrons and azaleas that reach full bloom in late May and early June. To the south is a walled garden planted with flowers and shrubs, and surrounded by the second area of ornamental planting. Between these two areas, and sweeping down to the loch shore, is an area of grassed parkland with specimen trees. The whole is framed by ornamental and semi-natural woodlands.[5] In 2001, a £2.3-million programme of works sought to restore the castle grounds, including the reopening of lost views and improved woodland management. Funding was provided by the Heritage Lottery Fund and Scottish Enterprise, as well as the council.[15]\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Balloch Castle.\nBalloch Castle - West Dunbartonshire Council\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",

M. W. Turner\nThe fore entrance to Linlithgow Palace, built by King James V around 1533, gave access to the outer enclosure surrounding the palace\nThe four European orders of chivalry to which James V belonged are engraved above the arch of the fore entrance: The Order of the Garter, The Order of the Thistle, The Order of the Golden Fleece, and The Order of St. Michael.[1]\nGreat Hall or Parliament House\nThe ruins of Linlithgow Palace are located in the town of Linlithgow, West Lothian, Scotland, 15 miles (24 km) west of Edinburgh. The palace was one of the principal residences of the monarchs of Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries. Although maintained after Scotland's monarchs left for England in 1603, the palace was little used, and was burned out in 1746. It is now a visitor attraction in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.\nOrigins\nA royal manor existed on the site from the 12th century.[2] This was later enclosed by a timber palisade and outer fosse to create a fortification known as 'the Peel', built in 1301/2[3] by occupying English forces under Edward I. The site of the manor made it an ideal military base for securing the supply routes between Edinburgh Castle and Stirling Castle. The English fort was begun in March 1302 under the supervision of two priests, Richard de Wynepol and Henry de Graundeston, to the designs of Master James of St George, who was also present.[4] In September 1302, sixty men and 140 women helped dig the ditches; the men were paid twopence and the women a penny daily.[5] One hundred foot-soldiers were still employed as labourers on the castle in November and work continued during the Summer of 1303.[6]\nElizabeth of Rhuddlan, a daughter of Edward I, was at Linlithgow Palace in July 1304. She was pregnant and travelled to Knaresborough Castle in England to have her child.[7] In September 1313, Linlithgow Peel was retaken for Scotland by an ordinary Scot named William Bynnie[8] or Bunnock[9] who was in the habit of selling hay to the garrison of the peel.[10] When the gate was opened for him, he halted his wagon so that it could not be closed, and he and his seven sons leapt out from their hiding place under the hay, and they captured the peel for King Robert the Bruce. King Robert sent reinforcements and had the peel dismantled so that it could not be retaken by the English.[11]\nIn January 1360, King David II visited Linlithgow and the peel was repaired 'for the king's coming'.[12]\nIn 1424, the town of Linlithgow was partially destroyed in a great fire.[13] King James I started the rebuilding of the palace as a grand residence for Scottish royalty, also beginning the rebuilding of the Church of St Michael immediately to the south of the palace: the earlier church had been used as a storeroom during Edward's occupation.[14] James I set out to build a palace rather than a heavily fortified castle, perhaps inspired by Sheen Palace which he probably visited in England. The royal apartments were decorated by Matthew the Painter in 1433.[15] Mary of Guelders, the widow of James II and mother of James III, made improvements in 1461, for the visit of the exiled Henry VI of England.[16] Over the following century the palace developed into a formal courtyard structure, with significant additions by James III and James IV.\nJames IV and Margaret Tudor\nJames IV bought crimson satin for a new doublet to wear while formally welcoming the Spanish ambassador Don Martin de Torre at Linlithgow in August 1489. Silverware and tapestries were brought from Edinburgh for the event, and the wardrobe servant David Caldwell brought cords and rings to hang the tapestry in the palace. New rushes were brought from the Haw of Lithgow for the chamber floor. Entertainment included a play performed by Patrick Johnson and his fellows.[17] After a visit to Stirling the King returned to Linlithgow and played dice with the Laird of Halkett and his Master of Household, and on 17 September rewarded stonemasons working on the palace with two gold angel coins.[18] In November 1497 he played cards and bought jesses and leashes to go hawking. James gave the masons working on the building a tip of 9 shillings, known as \"drinksilver\", and ordered the master mason to go to Stirling Castle to provide a plan for his new lodgings there. Andrew Cavers, Abbot of Lindores, was made supervisor of construction at Linlithgow.[19]\nJames IV spent Easter 1490 at the palace, visited the town of Culross, and returned on 18 April to play dice with Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus and the Laird of Halkett, losing 20 gold unicorn coins.[20] The King spent Christmas 1490 and Easter 1491 at Linlithgow. On 9 April he bought seeds for the palace gardener. The poet Blind Harry came to court at Linlithgow at least five times. James IV was interested in medicine and experimented taking blood from his servant Domenico and another man at Linlithgow.[21] Perkin Warbeck was a Christmas guest in 1495.[22] The king's mistress Margaret Drummond stayed at Linlithgow in the autumn of 1496.[23] The park dykes were rebuilt in 1498.[24]\nOn 31 May 1503 the palace was given to Margaret Tudor the bride of James IV.[25] It was to become the new queen's favourite home in Scotland.[26] A mason, Nichol Jackson, completed battlements on the west side of the palace in the summer of 1504. An African drummer known as the \"More taubronar\" performed at the palace.[27] When the King stayed at Linlithgow in July 1506 a coat was bought for a fool, and James IV visited the building work at the quire of St Michael's Church. He gave the master mason a tip of 9 shillings.[28] The son of James IV and Margaret Tudor, the future James V, was born in the palace in April 1512. The captain of the palace, Alexander McCulloch of Myreton, took on the role of the Prince's bodyguard.[29]\nThe household of Margaret Tudor at Linlithgow included the African servants Margaret and Ellen More.[30] In April 1513 the roof of the chapel was altered and renewed, and a new organ was made by a French musician and craftsman called Gilyem and fixed to the wall. Timber was shipped to Blackness Castle and carted to the Palace. The windows of the queen's oratory, overlooking the Loch, were reglazed.[31] An English diplomat, Nicholas West, came to the palace in April 1513 and was met by Sir John Sinclair, one of the courtiers featured in William Dunbar's poem Ane Dance in the Quenis Chalmer.[32] West talked to Margaret Tudor and saw the baby Prince. He wrote \"verily, he is a right fair child, and a large of his age\".[33]\nAfter the death of his father at the Battle of Flodden, the infant James V was not kept at Linlithgow, but came to the palace from Stirling Castle dressed in a new black velvet suit accompanied by minstrels in April 1517, and went on to take up residence in Edinburgh Castle.[34] Margaret Tudor rewarded the King's nurse and governess, Marion Douglas, with a grant of the lands near Linlithgow Palace called the Queen's Acres in July 1518. Marion's daughter, Katherine Bellenden, made the king's shirts.[35]\nJames V\nWhen the teenage James V came to Linlithgow in 1528, Thomas Hamilton supplied him with sugar candy.[36] James V added the outer gateway and the elaborate courtyard fountain.[37] The stonework of the south façade was renewed and unified for James V in the 1530s by the keeper, James Hamilton of Finnart.[38] Timber imported from Denmark-Norway, including \"Estland boards\" and joists, was bought at the harbours of Dundee, South Queensferry, Montrose, and Leith, and shipped to Blackness Castle to be carted to the palace. Three oak trees were cut down in Callender Wood to provide tables for dressing food in the kitchens, and seven oak trees from the Torwood. The improvements included altering the chapel ceiling and trees were brought from Callender to make scaffolding for this. Six hogshead barrels were bought to hold the scaffold in place.[39]\nThe older statues of the Pope, the Knight, and Labouring Man on the east side of the courtyard, with the inscriptions on ribbons held by angels were painted. New iron window grills, called yetts, were made by blacksmiths in Linlithgow, and these, with weather vanes, were painted with red lead and vermilion. A metal worker in Glasgow called George Clame made shutter catches for the windows and door locks in iron plated with tin. The chapel ceiling was painted with fine azurite. Thomas Peebles put stained glass in the chapel windows and the windows of the \"Lyon Chamber\", meaning the courtyard windows of the Great Hall.[40]\nA chaplain, Thomas Johnston, kept the palace watertight and had the wallwalks and gutters cleaned. Peter Johnstoun was the palace carpenter. Robert Murray looked after the lead roofs and the plumbing of the fountain.[41] There was a tennis court in the garden and an eel-trap in the Loch.[42] The lodgings built for the Queen in the 1530s may have been in the old north wing on the first floor. Only one side of a doorway from this period remains, which may have led to a grand staircase for the Queen.[43] When Mary of Guise arrived in Scotland, James Hamilton of Finnart was given 400 French gold crowns to repair the palace.[44] In August 1539 he was paid for rebuilding the king's kitchen, at the north end of the great hall, with a fireplace, an oven, and a room for silver vessels, and another for keeping coal.[45]\nDuring a visit in December 1539, Mary of Guise was provided with gold, silver, and black thread for embroidery, and her ladies' embroidery equipment was brought from Falkland Palace. Tapestry was brought from Edinburgh to decorate the palace. The goldsmiths Thomas Rynde and John Mosman provided chains, tablets or lockets, rings, precious stones, necklaces, and jewelled coifs for ladies called \"shaffrons\" for the King to give as gifts to his courtiers on New Year's Day. On the feast of the Epiphany in January the court watched an \"interlude\" that was an early version of David Lyndsay's play, A Satire of the Three Estates, in the Great Hall. Mary of Guise returned to Edinburgh on 3 February and was crowned soon afterwards.[46]\nMary, Queen of Scots\nMary, Queen of Scots, was born at Linlithgow Palace in December 1542 and lived at the palace for a time.[47] In January 1543, Viscount Lisle heard that she was kept with her mother, \"and nursed in her own chamber\".[48] In March 1543 the English ambassador Ralph Sadler rode from Edinburgh to see her for the first time.[49] Mary of Guise showed him the queen out of her swaddling and Sadler wrote that the infant was \"as goodly a child I have seen, and like to live\".[50] Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox came to see the infant queen on 5 April 1543.[51]\nThe blacksmith William Hill was employed at this time to increase the security of the palace by fitting iron window grills, called yetts. Alexander Livingston, 5th Lord Livingston was paid £813 for keeping the infant queen in the palace.[52] Regent Arran was worried his enemies, including Cardinal Beaton, would take Mary in July 1543.[53] He came with Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus and brought his artillery. He considered putting the queen in Blackness Castle, a stronger fortress. Henry VIII hoped that Mary would be separated from her mother and taken to Tantallon Castle. Mary was teething and plans to move her were delayed.[54]\nSupporters of the Auld Alliance at Linlithgow signed the \"Secret Bond\" pledging to prevent Mary marrying Prince Edward.[55] Following lengthy negotiations between the armed factions at Linlithgow, Mary was taken to Stirling Castle by her mother on 26 July 1543, escorted by the Earl of Lennox,[56] and an armed force described as a \"great army\".[57] Arran employed a carpenter from Linlithgow, Thomas Milne, to make three wooden chandeliers to hang in the palace in January 1546.[58]\nAs an adult Queen Mary often visited Linlithgow, but did not commission new building work at the palace. She returned on 14 January 1562 with her half-brother Lord James Stewart and received James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran as a guest. She returned to Edinburgh on 30 January after visiting Cumbernauld Castle.[59] Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, her second husband, played tennis at Linlithgow.[60] Mary came to Linlithgow in December 1565 to take the air and have a quiet time with few visitors, but her husband Lord Darnley was expected. She was pregnant and was carried to Linlithgow in a horse-litter.[61] She had a bed at Linlithgow of crimson velvet and damask embroidered with love knots.[62]\nJames VI\nIn the years after the abdication of Mary and the Marian Civil War, Captain Andrew Lambie and his lieutenant John Spreul kept an armed guard of 28 men of war at the Palace. An iron yett was brought to the Palace from Blackness Castle by Alexander Stewart in 1571.[63] Timber was used to fortify the church steeple.[64]\nIn March 1576 Regent Morton ordered some repairs to the roof and the kitchen chimney.[65] James VI of Scotland came to Linlithgow in May 1583, and his courtiers, including Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell and George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal played football.[66] James VI held a parliament in the great hall of the palace in December 1585, the first gathering of the whole nobility in the palace since the reign of his grandfather James V of Scotland.[67] James VI gave lands including the palace to his bride Anne of Denmark as a \"morning gift\". On 14 May 1590 Peder Munk, the Admiral of Denmark, rode to Linlithgow from Niddry Castle, and was welcomed at the palace by the keeper Lewis Bellenden. He took symbolic possession or (sasine) by accepting a handful of earth and stone.[68]\nThe keeper of the palace in 1594 was the English courtier Roger Aston who repaired the roof using lead shipped from England.[69] Roger Aston was of doubtful parentage and as a joke hung a copy of his family tree next to that of the king of France in the long gallery, which James VI found very amusing.[70] There was a private stair accessing the king's apartments, and the Laird of Dundas claimed to have encountered the Queen there in the dark without recognising her.[71]\nIn January 1595 John Stewart, 5th Earl of Atholl, Simon Fraser, 6th Lord Lovat, and Kenneth Mackenzie were kept prisoners in the palace, in order to pacify \"Highland matters\".[72] Lord Lovat gained the king's favour and soon after married one of Anne of Denmark's ladies in waiting, Jean Stewart, a daughter of James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune.[73] Roger Aston helped the queen move to Linlithgow Palace at the end of May 1595.[74] Over several days at Linlithgow in June 1595, James VI and Anne had discussions about the keeping of their son Prince Henry by the Earl of Mar. Anne refused to talk to Mar when he came to Linlithgow.[75]\nThe daughter of James VI and Anne, Princess Elizabeth, lived in the palace in the care of Helenor Hay, Countess of Linlithgow, helped by Mary Kennedy, Lady Ochiltree.[76] Alison Hay was her nurse, helped by her sister Elizabeth Hay.[77] John Fairny was appointed to guard her chamber door.[78] In 1599 James VI had to write to the Linlithgow burgh council about townspeople who had built houses which obstructed a route taken by the royal horses to water, and houses and gardens built near the loch (in recent times of drought) which hindered the royal laundry.[79]\nAnne of Denmark came to visit Princess Elizabeth at Linlithgow Palace on 7 May 1603, and then rode to Stirling Castle, where she argued again with Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar and the Master of Mar over the custody of Prince Henry.[80] She brought Prince Henry to Linlithgow on 27 May, and after a week in Edinburgh, went to London.[81] In 1616 Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow said there was still a tapestry from the royal collection at Linlithgow, used in Prince Henry's chamber. The tapestry had been damaged by the fool Andrew Cockburn. The Earl had decorated Princess Elizabeth's rooms with his own tapestry.[82]\nDecay and repair\nAfter the Union of the Crowns in 1603 the Royal Court became largely based in England and Linlithgow was used very little. The North Range, said to be in very poor condition in 1583,[83] and \"ruinous\" in 1599,[84] collapsed at 4am on 6 September 1607. The Earl of Linlithgow wrote to King James VI & I with the news:Please your most Sacred Majestie; this sext of September, betuixt thre and four in the morning, the north quarter of your Majesties Palice of Linlithgw is fallin, rufe and all, within the wallis, to the ground; but the wallis ar standing yit, bot lukis everie moment when the inner wall sall fall and brek your Majesties fontane.\"[85]\nKing James had the north range rebuilt between 1618 and 1622. The carving was designed by the mason William Wallace. In July 1620, the architect, James Murray of Kilbaberton, estimated that 3,000 stones in weight of lead would be needed to cover the roof, costing £3,600 in Pound Scots (the Scottish money of the time).[86] Scottish lead was sent from Leadhills in Lanarkshire by John Fairlie.[87]\nAfter the death of the depute-treasurer Gideon Murray who was supervising the project, King James put the Earl of Mar in charge of the \"speedy finishing of our Palace of Linlithgow\". On 5 July 1621 the Earl of Mar wrote to James to tell him he had met James Murray, the master of works, and viewed the works at \"grate lenthe\". Mar said the Palace would be ready for the King at Michaelmas. King James planned to visit Scotland in 1622, but never returned.[88]\nThe carving at the window-heads and the Royal Arms of Scotland on the new courtyard façade were painted and gilded, as were the old statues of the Pope, Knight, and Labouring Man on the east side.[89] In 1629 John Binning, James Workman, and John Sawyers painted the interiors with decorative friezes above walls left plain for tapestries and hangings.[90] Despite these efforts, the only reigning monarch to stay at Linlithgow after that date was King Charles I, who spent a night there in 1633. As part of the preparations, the burgh council issued a proclamation forbidding the wearing of plaids and blue bonnets, a costume deemed \"indecent\".[91]\nIn 1648, part of the new North Range was occupied by Alexander Livingston, 2nd Earl of Linlithgow.[92] An English visitor in October 1641 recorded in a poem that the roof of the great hall was already gone, the fountain vandalised by those who objected on religious grounds to the motto \"God Save the King,\" but some woodcarving remained in the Chapel Royal.[93]\nThe palace was again described as ruinous in 1668. Its swansong came in September 1745, when Bonnie Prince Charlie visited Linlithgow on his march south but did not stay overnight. It is said that the fountain was made to flow with wine in his honour.[94] The Duke of Cumberland's army destroyed most of the palace buildings by accidentally burning it through lamps left on straw bedding on the night of 31 January/1 February 1746.\nKeepers and Captains of the Palace\nThe positions of official keeper and captain of the palace have been held by: Andrew Cavers, Abbot of Lindores, 1498;[95] John Ramsay of Trarinzeane, 1503;[96] James Hamilton of Finnart, 1534, Captain and Keeper; William Danielstoun from 19 November 1540; Robert Hamilton of Briggis, from 22 August 1543; Andrew Melville of Murdocairney, later Lord Melville of Monimail, brother of James Melville of Halhill, from 15 February 1567; George Boyd, deputy Captain, 1564; Andrew Ferrier, Captain of the Palace, 1565, Frenchman and archer of the Queen's Guard;[97] John Brown, June 1569; Andrew Lambie, June 1571;[98] Ludovic Bellenden of Auchnoul 22 November 1587, and 1595 Roger Aston. The office was acquired by Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow, and remained in that family until 1715 when the rights returned to the Crown.[99]\nA Scottish heraldic manuscript known as The Deidis of Armorie dating from the late 15th-century and derived and translated from a variety of sources, outlines the duties of keepers and captains:\"The capitanys war ordanit be princis to keip the fortrassis and gud townys of the princis and to vittaill thaim and garnys thaim of al necessar thingis petenyng to the wer; ... and gar mak certane and sur wachis be him and his folkis, baith be nycht and day, ffor dout of ganfalling in pestilence, sua that he may rendre gud compt of the place quhen tym and place requiris\"(modernised) The Captains were ordained by princes to keep the fortresses and good towns of the princes, and to stock them with food and furnish armaments in case of war; ... and to make sure and certain watch, himself and his kinsfolk, both by night and day, For fear of succumbing to the plague, so that he may render good account of the place, when time and place requires.[100]\nPresent day\nLong-neglected, the palace passed into the care of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, together with the surrounding grounds, in 1832. It passed to the Office of Works in 1874. Major consolidation works were undertaken in the 1930s and 1940s.[101]\nToday the palace is managed and maintained by Historic Environment Scotland. The site is open to visitors all year round, usually subject to an entrance fee for non-members, but on occasion the entry fee is waived during the organisation's \"Doors open days\".[102] In summer the adjacent 15th-century parish church of St Michael is open for visitors, allowing a combined visit to two of Scotland's finest surviving medieval buildings. The site was visited by 103,312 people in 2019.[103]\nFor over 40 years, tours of the palace for children have been led by 'Junior Guides', pupils at Linlithgow Primary School.[104]\nLinlithgow Palace at night\nA Strathspey for bagpipes was composed in honour of Linlithgow Palace.[105]\nThe palace is said to be haunted by the spectre of Mary of Guise, mother to Mary, Queen of Scots.[106]\nArtistic and cultural uses\nOn 4 December 2012, the French fashion house Chanel held its tenth Métiers d’Art show in the palace. The collection, designed by Karl Lagerfeld, was called 'Paris-Édimbourg' and inspired by classic Scottish styling using tweed and tartan fabrics worn by models Stella Tennant, Cara Delevingne, and Edie Campbell.\nThe show renewed media interest in the possibility of restoring the roof of the palace.[107]\nIn August 2014, a music festival was held on the palace's grounds called 'Party at the Palace'. This became a yearly event and again took place in 2015; from 2016 it was moved to the other side of the loch due to its popularity and need for more space. The festival still boasts views of the palace.\nSome scenes in the time-travelling romance TV series Outlander are set at a fictional castle for which Linlithgow Palace stands in; this has attracted a number of international tourists.[108]\nReferences\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Linlithgow Palace.\nHistoric Environment Scotland. \"Linlithgow Palace, Peel and Royal Park (SM13099)\".\nAerial photos Archived 23 September 2015 at the Wayback Machine\n55°58′42.6″N 3°36′4.0″W / 55.978500°N 3.601111°W / 55.978500; -3.601111\n<img src=\"https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&amp;type=1x1&amp;usesul3=0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none; position: absolute;\">",
